      "generally accepted modern rule is that a corporation may be subject to indictment and\n",

      "1955, Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, Employees' Provident Fund (Miscellaneous\n",
      "Provision) Act, 1952, etc., have created such vicarious liability. It is interesting to note\n",
      "that section 14A of the 1952 Act speciﬁcally creates an offence of criminal breach of\n",

      "(c) Alien enemies.—In respect of acts of war alien enemies cannot be tried by criminal\n",
      "Courts. If an alien enemy commits a crime unconnected with war, e.g., theft, he would\n",
      "be triable by ordinary criminal Courts.\n",

      "(e) Warships.—Men-of-war of a State in foreign waters are exempt from the jurisdiction\n",

      "accordance with principles of international law, will accord to the ship and its crew and\n",
      "its contents certain immunities. The immunities can, in any case, be waived by the\n",
      "nation to which the public ship belongs.26.\n",
      "(f) President and Governors.—Under Article 361 of the Indian Constitution, the\n",
      "President and Governors are exempt from the jurisdiction of Courts.\n",
      "2. 'Within India'.—If the offence is committed outside India it is not punishable under\n",
      "the Penal Code, unless it has been made so by means of special provisions such as\n",
      "sections 3, 4, 108A, etc., of the Code. Under section179 of the Cr PC, 1973 even the\n",

      "(1) any citizen of India in any place, wherever he may be;\n",
      "(2) any person on any ship or aircraft registered in India wherever it may be; and\n",

      "Where an offence is committed beyond the limits of India but the offender is found\n",
      "within its limits, then\n",
      "(I) he may be given up for trial in the country where the offence was committed\n",
      "(extradition) or\n",
      "(II) he may be tried in India (extraterritorial jurisdiction).\n",
      "Where an offence was committed by an Indian citizen outside India, it was held that the\n",

      "not require sanction of the Central Government under the proviso to section 188, Cr PC,\n",
      "1973. But an enquiry as contemplated by section 202, Cr PC, 1973 could only be with\n",
      "the sanction of the Central Government.55.\n",
      "(I) Extradition.—Extradition is the surrender by one State to another of a person desired\n",
      "to be dealt with for crimes of which he has been accused or convicted and which are\n",
      "justiciable in the Courts of the other State. Surrender of a person within the State to\n",
      "another State—whether a citizen or an alien—is a political act done in pursuance of a\n",
      "treaty or an arrangement ad hoc.56. Though extradition is granted in implementation of\n",
      "the international commitment of the State, the procedure to be followed by the Courts\n",
      "in deciding, whether extradition should be granted and on what terms, is determined by\n",
      "the municipal law of the land. Extradition is founded on the broad principle that it is in\n",
      "the interest of civilised communities that criminals should not go unpunished and on\n",
      "that account, it is recognised as a part of the comity of nations that one State should\n",
      "ordinarily afford to another State assistance towards bringing offenders to justice.57.\n",
      "The procedure for securing the extradition from India is laid down in the Extradition Act,\n",
      "1962.\n",

      "committed out of India on (A) land, (B) high seas or (C) aircraft.\n",
      "(A) Land.—By virtue of sections 3 and 4 of the Penal Code, and section 188 of the Cr\n",
      "PC, 1973 local Courts can take cognizance of offences committed beyond the\n",

      "citizen of India which would be an offence punishable under the Penal Code if it had\n",
      "been committed in India, section 4 constitutes the act an offence and it can be dealt\n",

      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "the offence the accused person is not a citizen of India, the provisions of section 4 of\n",
      "the Penal Code and section 188 of the Cr PC, 1973 have no application.59.\n",
      "Section 188 of the Cr PC, 1973, provides that when an offence is committed outside\n",
      "India—\n",
      "(a) by a citizen of India, whether on high seas or elsewhere; or\n",
      "(b) by any person not being such citizen on any ship or aircraft registered in India,\n",
      "he may be dealt with in respect of such offence as if it had been committed at\n",
      "any place within India at which he may be found.\n",
      "The word 'found' in section 188, Cr PC, 1973 means not where a person is discovered\n",
      "but where he is actually present.60. A man brought to a place against his will can be\n",
      "said to be found there.61. When a man is in the country and is charged before a\n",
      "Magistrate with an offence under the Penal Code, it will not avail him to say that he was\n",
      "brought there illegally from a foreign country. The Bombay High Court has laid down\n",
      "this principle, following English precedents, in Savarkar's case.62. The accused Savarkar\n",
      "had escaped at Mareseilles from the custody of police oﬃcers charged with the duty of\n",
      "bringing him from London to Bombay, but was re-arrested there and brought to Bombay\n",
      "and committed for trial by the Special Magistrate at Nasik. The High Court held that the\n",
      "trial and committal were valid.63. The provisions of the IPC, 1860 have been extended\n",
      "to offences committed by any citizen of India in any place within and beyond India by\n",
      "virtue of section 4 thereof. Accordingly, offences committed in Botswana by an Indian\n",
      "citizen would also be amenable to the provisions of the IPC, 1860 subject to the\n",
      "limitation imposed under the proviso to section 188 Cr PC, 1973.64. Section 4 gives\n",

      "(B) Admiralty jurisdiction.—The jurisdiction to try offences committed on the high seas\n",
      "is known as the admiralty jurisdiction. It is founded on the principle that a ship on the\n",
      "high seas is a ﬂoating island belonging to the nation whose ﬂag she is ﬂying.\n",

      "section 34, IPC, 1860 is the joint liability in doing a criminal act.172.\n",
      "[s 34.1] History.—\n",
      "Section 34 IPC, 1860 is part of the original Code of 1860 as drafted by Lord Macaulay.\n",
      "The original section as it stood was \"When a criminal act is done by several persons,\n",
      "each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by\n",
      "him alone.\" However, on account of certain observations made by Sir Barnes Peacock,\n",
      "CJ, in Queen v Gora Chand Gope,173. it was necessary to bring about a change in the\n",
      "wordings of the section. Accordingly, in the year 1870 an amendment was brought\n",
      "which introduced the following words after \"when a criminal act is done by several\n",
      "persons...\" \"…in furtherance of the common intention...\". After this change, the section\n",
      "has not been changed or amended ever.\n",
      "[s 34.2] Object.—\n",
      "The provision is intended to meet a case in which it may be diﬃcult to distinguish\n",
      "between acts of individual members of a party who act in furtherance of the common\n",
      "intention of all or to prove exactly what part was taken by each of them. The true\n",
      "contents of the section are that if two or more persons intentionally do an act jointly,\n",
      "the position in law is just the same as if each of them has done it individually by\n",
      "himself. As observed in Ashok Kumar v State of Punjab,174. the existence of a common\n",
      "intention amongst the participants in a crime is the essential element for application of\n",
      "this section. It is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "commission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar. The acts may\n",
      "be different in character, but must have been actuated by one and the same common\n",
      "intention in order to attract the provision.175. Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,176.\n",
      "stated the true purport of section 34 as:\n",
      "The words of s.34 are not to be eviscerated by reading them in this exceedingly limited\n",
      "sense. By s.33 a criminal act in s.34 includes a series of acts and, further, 'act' includes\n",
      "omission to act, for example, an omission to interfere in order to prevent a murder being\n",
      "done before one's very eyes. By s.37, when any offence is committed by means of several\n",
      "acts whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one\n",
      "of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Even if the\n",
      "appellant did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as\n",
      "in other things 'they also serve who only stand and wait'.177.\n",
      "[s 34.3] Principle.—\n",
      "This section is only a rule of evidence and does not create a substantive offence.\n",
      "Section 34 IPC, 1860 lays down the principle of constructive liability. The essence of\n",
      "section 34 IPC, 1860 is a simultaneous consensus of the minds of the persons\n",
      "participating in criminal action to bring about a particular result. Section 34 IPC, 1860\n",
      "stipulates that the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention. In\n",
      "fact, the section is intended to cover a case where a number of persons act together\n",
      "and on the facts of the case it is not possible for the prosecution to prove as to which\n",
      "of the persons who acted together actually committed the crime. Little or no distinction\n",
      "exists between a charge for an offence under a particular section and a charge under\n",
      "that section read with section 34.178. Therefore, section 34, IPC, 1860, would apply\n",
      "even if no charge is framed under that section provided of course from the evidence it\n",
      "becomes clear that there was pre-arranged plan to achieve the commonly intended\n",
      "object.179. Thus, where six persons were charged under sections 148, 302/149 and\n",
      "307/149, IPC, 1860, but two were acquitted, the remaining four accused could be\n",
      "convicted on the charges of murder and attempt to murder with the aid of section 34 of\n",
      "the Penal Code.180. This section really means that if two or more persons intentionally\n",
      "do a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually.181. If the\n",
      "criminal act was a fresh and independent act springing wholly from the mind of the\n",
      "doer, the others are not liable merely because when it was done they were intending to\n",
      "be partakers with the doer in a different criminal act.\n",
      "[s 34.4] Scope, ambit and applicability.—\n",
      "Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code recognises the principle of vicarious liability in\n",
      "criminal jurisprudence. The said principle enshrined under Section 34 of the Code\n",
      "would be attracted only if one or more than one accused person act conjointly in the\n",
      "commission of offence with others. It is not necessary that all such persons should be\n",
      "named and identiﬁed before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can\n",
      "be invoked. So long as the evidence brought by the prosecution would disclose that\n",
      "one or more accused persons had acted in concert with other persons not named or\n",
      "identiﬁed, the liability under Section 34 of the Code would still be attracted. Once the\n",
      "other accused stands acquitted in absence of said evidence, the vicarious liability\n",
      "under section 34 of the Code would not be attracted so as to hold the accused liable\n",
      "for the offence with the aid of Section 34 of the Code. However, the accused would still\n",
      "be liable for the offence if the injury or injuries leading to offence can be attributed to\n",
      "him.182. A bare reading of this section shows that the section could be dissected as\n",
      "follows:\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "(a) Criminal act is done by several persons;\n",
      "(b) Such act is done in furtherance of the common intention of all; and\n",
      "(c) Each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done\n",
      "by him alone.\n",
      "(d) But, it is not necessary that all such persons should be named and identiﬁed\n",
      "before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be invoked.183.\n",
      "In other words, these three ingredients would guide the court in determining whether an\n",
      "accused is liable to be convicted with the aid of section 34. While ﬁrst two are the acts\n",
      "which are attributable and have to be proved as actions of the accused, the third is the\n",
      "consequence. Once the criminal act and common intention are proved, then by ﬁction\n",
      "of law, criminal liability of having done that act by each person individually would arise.\n",
      "The criminal act, according to section 34 IPC, 1860 must be done by several persons.\n",
      "The emphasis in this part of the section is on the word \"done\".184. The section does not\n",
      "envisage the separate act by all the accused persons for becoming responsible for the\n",
      "ultimate criminal act. If such an interpretation is accepted, the purpose of section 34\n",
      "shall be rendered infructuous.185. Under section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, a pre-\n",
      "concert in the sense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary to be proved.186. It is a\n",
      "well settled law that mere presence or association with other members is not per se\n",
      "suﬃcient to hold each of them criminally liable for the offences committed by the other\n",
      "members, unless there is suﬃcient evidence on record to show that one such member\n",
      "also intends to or knows the likelihood of commission of such an offending act.187.\n",
      "[s 34.5] Three leading Cases.—\n",
      "The case of Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,188. is a locus classicus and has\n",
      "been followed by number of High Courts and the Supreme Court in a large number of\n",
      "cases. In this case, the Judicial Committee dealt with the scope of section 34 dealing\n",
      "with the acts done in furtherance of the common intention, making all equally liable for\n",
      "the results of all the acts of others. It was observed that section 34 when it speaks of a\n",
      "criminal act done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, has\n",
      "regard not to the offence as a whole, but to the criminal act, that is to say, the totality of\n",
      "the series of acts which result in the offence. In the case of a person assaulted by\n",
      "many accused, the criminal act is the offence which ﬁnally results, though the\n",
      "achievement of that criminal act may be the result of the action of several persons.\n",
      "In another celebrated case Mehbub Shah v King-Emperor,189. the court held that:\n",
      "Section 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section\n",
      "does not say \"the common intentions of all,\" nor does it say \"an intention common to all.\"\n",
      "Under the section, the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common\n",
      "intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such\n",
      "intention. To invoke the aid of s.34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act\n",
      "complained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance of the\n",
      "common intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any\n",
      "one of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. This being the\n",
      "principle, it is clear to their Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the\n",
      "section implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the\n",
      "section it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-\n",
      "arranged plan.\n",
      "Approving the judgments of the Privy Council in Barendra Kumar Ghosh (Barendra\n",
      "Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,190. and Mahbub Shah cases191 a three-Judge Bench of\n",
      "Supreme Court in Pandurang v State of Hyderabad,192. held that to attract the\n",
      "applicability of section 34 of the Code the prosecution is under an obligation to\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "establish that there existed a common intention which requires a pre-arranged plan\n",
      "because before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the\n",
      "act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention of all. The Court had\n",
      "in mind the ultimate act done in furtherance of the common intention\n",
      "[s 34.6] Common intention and mens rea.—\n",
      "Under section 34, every individual offender is associated with the criminal act which\n",
      "constitutes the offence both physically as well as mentally i.e. he is a participant not\n",
      "only in what has been described as a common act but also what is termed as the\n",
      "common intention and, therefore, in both these respects his individual role is put into\n",
      "serious jeopardy although this individual role might be a part of a common scheme in\n",
      "which others have also joined him and played a role that is similar or different. But\n",
      "referring to the common intention, it needs to be clariﬁed that the courts must keep in\n",
      "mind the ﬁne distinction between \"common intention\" on the one hand and mens rea as\n",
      "understood in criminal jurisprudence on the other. Common intention is not alike or\n",
      "identical to mens rea. The latter may be coincidental with or collateral to the former but\n",
      "they are distinct and different.193.\n",
      "[s 34.7] Participation.—\n",
      "Participation of several persons in some action with the common intention of\n",
      "committing a crime is an essential ingredient; once such participation is established,\n",
      "section 34 is at once attracted.194. Thus, the dominant feature of section 34 is the\n",
      "element of intention and participation in action. This participation need not in all cases\n",
      "be by physical presence.195. The Supreme Court has held that it is the essence of the\n",
      "section that the person must be physically present at the actual commission of the\n",
      "crime. He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a\n",
      "gate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a\n",
      "car on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape, but he must be physically present\n",
      "at the scene of the occurrence and must actually participate in the commission of the\n",
      "offence in some way or other at the time crime is actually being committed.196.\n",
      "The Supreme Court has emphasised that proof of participation by acceptable evidence\n",
      "may in circumstances be a clue to the common intention and that it would not be fatal\n",
      "to the prosecution case that the culprits had no community of interests.197.\n",
      "Sometimes, however, absence of actual participation may serve an important purpose\n",
      "as it happened, for example, where in a love triangle the paramour killed the woman's\n",
      "husband and she remained sitting with the dead body inside the house without opening\n",
      "the door. The main accused having been acquitted, the Supreme Court held that the\n",
      "woman alone could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34\n",
      "particularly in view of the fact that the nature of the injuries (gandasa blows with a\n",
      "heavy hand) made it explicit that they were the handiwork of masculine power and not\n",
      "that of feminine hands.198. It is also necessary to remember that mere presence of the\n",
      "offender at the scene of murder without any participation to facilitate the offence is not\n",
      "enough.199. By merely accompanying the accused one does not become liable for the\n",
      "crime committed by the accused within the meaning of section 34, IPC, 1860.200. The\n",
      "degree of participation is also an important factor.201. The court restated the two\n",
      "ingredients for application of the section which are:\n",
      "(i)\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "common intention to commit a crime, and\n",
      "(ii) participation by all the accused in the act or acts in furtherance of the common\n",
      "intention. These two things establish their joint liability.202.\n",
      "Where one of the accused persons focussed light on the victim with a torch so as to\n",
      "enable others to assault him, otherwise it is a dark night. The court said that his\n",
      "conduct prior and subsequent to the occurrence clearly showed that he shared the\n",
      "common intention so far as the assault on the deceased was concerned. Hence, he\n",
      "was rightly roped in under section 34.203. If participation is proved and common\n",
      "intention is absent, section 34 cannot be invoked.204. The co-accused was standing\n",
      "outside the house, where the incident took place, while the others committed the\n",
      "murder. There is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime. He did not even\n",
      "act as a guard; he did not prevent the witness from entering the house. There is no\n",
      "evidence of the formation or sharing of any common intention with the other accused.\n",
      "No weapon was seized from him, nor was any property connected with the crime,\n",
      "conﬁscated from him. It was therefore, held that, it was not safe to convict the co-\n",
      "accused of the offence of murder with the aid of sub-sections 34 and 120(B).205.\n",
      "[s 34.8] Physical Presence not sine qua non.—\n",
      "Physical presence at the very spot is not always a necessary ingredient to attract the\n",
      "action. The Supreme Court decision in Shreekantiah Ramayya v State of Bombay,206. is\n",
      "the authority for the aforesaid proposition. Vivian Bose, J, speaking for the Bench of\n",
      "three Judges stated thus:\n",
      "He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate\n",
      "outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a\n",
      "nearby road ready to facilitate their escape.\n",
      "What is required is his actual participation in the commission of the offence in some\n",
      "way or other at the time when the crime is actually being committed. The participation\n",
      "need not in all cases be by physical presence. In offence involving physical violence,\n",
      "normally presence at the scene of offence may be necessary, but such is not the case\n",
      "in respect of other offences when the offence consists of diverse acts which may be\n",
      "done at different times and places. The physical presence at the scene of offence of\n",

      "THE INDIAN PENAL CODE\n",
      "CHAPTER II GENERAL EXPLANATIONS\n",
      "THIS Chapter is for the most part an elaborate interpretation clause. It is a key to the\n",
      "interpretation of the whole Code. The leading terms used are here deﬁned and\n",
      "explained and the meanings thus, announced are steadily adhered to throughout the\n",
      "subsequent chapters.\n",
      "170.[[s 34] Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.\n",
      "When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common\n",
      "intention 1 of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it\n",
      "were done by him alone.]\n",
      "COMMENT—\n",
      "Introduction.—Ordinarily, no man can be held responsible for an independent act and\n",
      "wrong committed by another. However, section 34 of the IPC, 1860 makes an exception\n",
      "to this principle. It lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act.\n",
      "The essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of common intention,\n",
      "animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such\n",
      "intention. It deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or adverse by several\n",
      "persons, if all are done in furtherance of common intention. In such situation, each\n",
      "person is liable for the result of that as if he had done that act himself.171. The soul of\n",
      "section 34, IPC, 1860 is the joint liability in doing a criminal act.172.\n",
      "[s 34.1] History.—\n",
      "Section 34 IPC, 1860 is part of the original Code of 1860 as drafted by Lord Macaulay.\n",
      "The original section as it stood was \"When a criminal act is done by several persons,\n",
      "each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by\n",
      "him alone.\" However, on account of certain observations made by Sir Barnes Peacock,\n",
      "CJ, in Queen v Gora Chand Gope,173. it was necessary to bring about a change in the\n",
      "wordings of the section. Accordingly, in the year 1870 an amendment was brought\n",
      "which introduced the following words after \"when a criminal act is done by several\n",
      "persons...\" \"…in furtherance of the common intention...\". After this change, the section\n",
      "has not been changed or amended ever.\n",
      "[s 34.2] Object.—\n",
      "The provision is intended to meet a case in which it may be diﬃcult to distinguish\n",
      "between acts of individual members of a party who act in furtherance of the common\n",
      "intention of all or to prove exactly what part was taken by each of them. The true\n",
      "contents of the section are that if two or more persons intentionally do an act jointly,\n",
      "the position in law is just the same as if each of them has done it individually by\n",
      "himself. As observed in Ashok Kumar v State of Punjab,174. the existence of a common\n",
      "intention amongst the participants in a crime is the essential element for application of\n",
      "this section. It is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with\n",
      "commission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar. The acts may\n",
      "be different in character, but must have been actuated by one and the same common\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "intention in order to attract the provision.175. Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,176.\n",
      "stated the true purport of section 34 as:\n",
      "The words of s.34 are not to be eviscerated by reading them in this exceedingly limited\n",
      "sense. By s.33 a criminal act in s.34 includes a series of acts and, further, 'act' includes\n",
      "omission to act, for example, an omission to interfere in order to prevent a murder being\n",
      "done before one's very eyes. By s.37, when any offence is committed by means of several\n",
      "acts whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one\n",
      "of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Even if the\n",
      "appellant did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as\n",
      "in other things 'they also serve who only stand and wait'.177.\n",
      "[s 34.3] Principle.—\n",
      "This section is only a rule of evidence and does not create a substantive offence.\n",
      "Section 34 IPC, 1860 lays down the principle of constructive liability. The essence of\n",
      "section 34 IPC, 1860 is a simultaneous consensus of the minds of the persons\n",
      "participating in criminal action to bring about a particular result. Section 34 IPC, 1860\n",
      "stipulates that the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention. In\n",
      "fact, the section is intended to cover a case where a number of persons act together\n",
      "and on the facts of the case it is not possible for the prosecution to prove as to which\n",
      "of the persons who acted together actually committed the crime. Little or no distinction\n",
      "exists between a charge for an offence under a particular section and a charge under\n",
      "that section read with section 34.178. Therefore, section 34, IPC, 1860, would apply\n",
      "even if no charge is framed under that section provided of course from the evidence it\n",
      "becomes clear that there was pre-arranged plan to achieve the commonly intended\n",
      "object.179. Thus, where six persons were charged under sections 148, 302/149 and\n",
      "307/149, IPC, 1860, but two were acquitted, the remaining four accused could be\n",
      "convicted on the charges of murder and attempt to murder with the aid of section 34 of\n",
      "the Penal Code.180. This section really means that if two or more persons intentionally\n",
      "do a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually.181. If the\n",
      "criminal act was a fresh and independent act springing wholly from the mind of the\n",
      "doer, the others are not liable merely because when it was done they were intending to\n",
      "be partakers with the doer in a different criminal act.\n",
      "[s 34.4] Scope, ambit and applicability.—\n",
      "Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code recognises the principle of vicarious liability in\n",
      "criminal jurisprudence. The said principle enshrined under Section 34 of the Code\n",
      "would be attracted only if one or more than one accused person act conjointly in the\n",
      "commission of offence with others. It is not necessary that all such persons should be\n",
      "named and identiﬁed before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can\n",
      "be invoked. So long as the evidence brought by the prosecution would disclose that\n",
      "one or more accused persons had acted in concert with other persons not named or\n",
      "identiﬁed, the liability under Section 34 of the Code would still be attracted. Once the\n",
      "other accused stands acquitted in absence of said evidence, the vicarious liability\n",
      "under section 34 of the Code would not be attracted so as to hold the accused liable\n",
      "for the offence with the aid of Section 34 of the Code. However, the accused would still\n",
      "be liable for the offence if the injury or injuries leading to offence can be attributed to\n",
      "him.182. A bare reading of this section shows that the section could be dissected as\n",
      "follows:\n",
      "(a) Criminal act is done by several persons;\n",
      "(b) Such act is done in furtherance of the common intention of all; and\n",
      "(c) Each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done\n",
      "by him alone.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "(d) But, it is not necessary that all such persons should be named and identiﬁed\n",
      "before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be invoked.183.\n",
      "In other words, these three ingredients would guide the court in determining whether an\n",
      "accused is liable to be convicted with the aid of section 34. While ﬁrst two are the acts\n",
      "which are attributable and have to be proved as actions of the accused, the third is the\n",
      "consequence. Once the criminal act and common intention are proved, then by ﬁction\n",
      "of law, criminal liability of having done that act by each person individually would arise.\n",
      "The criminal act, according to section 34 IPC, 1860 must be done by several persons.\n",
      "The emphasis in this part of the section is on the word \"done\".184. The section does not\n",
      "envisage the separate act by all the accused persons for becoming responsible for the\n",
      "ultimate criminal act. If such an interpretation is accepted, the purpose of section 34\n",
      "shall be rendered infructuous.185. Under section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, a pre-\n",
      "concert in the sense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary to be proved.186. It is a\n",
      "well settled law that mere presence or association with other members is not per se\n",
      "suﬃcient to hold each of them criminally liable for the offences committed by the other\n",
      "members, unless there is suﬃcient evidence on record to show that one such member\n",
      "also intends to or knows the likelihood of commission of such an offending act.187.\n",
      "[s 34.5] Three leading Cases.—\n",
      "The case of Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,188. is a locus classicus and has\n",
      "been followed by number of High Courts and the Supreme Court in a large number of\n",
      "cases. In this case, the Judicial Committee dealt with the scope of section 34 dealing\n",
      "with the acts done in furtherance of the common intention, making all equally liable for\n",
      "the results of all the acts of others. It was observed that section 34 when it speaks of a\n",
      "criminal act done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, has\n",
      "regard not to the offence as a whole, but to the criminal act, that is to say, the totality of\n",
      "the series of acts which result in the offence. In the case of a person assaulted by\n",
      "many accused, the criminal act is the offence which ﬁnally results, though the\n",
      "achievement of that criminal act may be the result of the action of several persons.\n",
      "In another celebrated case Mehbub Shah v King-Emperor,189. the court held that:\n",
      "Section 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section\n",
      "does not say \"the common intentions of all,\" nor does it say \"an intention common to all.\"\n",
      "Under the section, the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common\n",
      "intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such\n",
      "intention. To invoke the aid of s.34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act\n",
      "complained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance of the\n",
      "common intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any\n",
      "one of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. This being the\n",
      "principle, it is clear to their Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the\n",
      "section implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the\n",
      "section it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-\n",
      "arranged plan.\n",
      "Approving the judgments of the Privy Council in Barendra Kumar Ghosh (Barendra\n",
      "Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,190. and Mahbub Shah cases191 a three-Judge Bench of\n",
      "Supreme Court in Pandurang v State of Hyderabad,192. held that to attract the\n",
      "applicability of section 34 of the Code the prosecution is under an obligation to\n",
      "establish that there existed a common intention which requires a pre-arranged plan\n",
      "because before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the\n",
      "act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention of all. The Court had\n",
      "in mind the ultimate act done in furtherance of the common intention\n",
      "[s 34.6] Common intention and mens rea.—\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Under section 34, every individual offender is associated with the criminal act which\n",
      "constitutes the offence both physically as well as mentally i.e. he is a participant not\n",
      "only in what has been described as a common act but also what is termed as the\n",
      "common intention and, therefore, in both these respects his individual role is put into\n",
      "serious jeopardy although this individual role might be a part of a common scheme in\n",
      "which others have also joined him and played a role that is similar or different. But\n",
      "referring to the common intention, it needs to be clariﬁed that the courts must keep in\n",
      "mind the ﬁne distinction between \"common intention\" on the one hand and mens rea as\n",
      "understood in criminal jurisprudence on the other. Common intention is not alike or\n",
      "identical to mens rea. The latter may be coincidental with or collateral to the former but\n",
      "they are distinct and different.193.\n",
      "[s 34.7] Participation.—\n",
      "Participation of several persons in some action with the common intention of\n",
      "committing a crime is an essential ingredient; once such participation is established,\n",
      "section 34 is at once attracted.194. Thus, the dominant feature of section 34 is the\n",
      "element of intention and participation in action. This participation need not in all cases\n",
      "be by physical presence.195. The Supreme Court has held that it is the essence of the\n",
      "section that the person must be physically present at the actual commission of the\n",
      "crime. He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a\n",
      "gate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a\n",
      "car on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape, but he must be physically present\n",
      "at the scene of the occurrence and must actually participate in the commission of the\n",
      "offence in some way or other at the time crime is actually being committed.196.\n",
      "The Supreme Court has emphasised that proof of participation by acceptable evidence\n",
      "may in circumstances be a clue to the common intention and that it would not be fatal\n",
      "to the prosecution case that the culprits had no community of interests.197.\n",
      "Sometimes, however, absence of actual participation may serve an important purpose\n",
      "as it happened, for example, where in a love triangle the paramour killed the woman's\n",
      "husband and she remained sitting with the dead body inside the house without opening\n",
      "the door. The main accused having been acquitted, the Supreme Court held that the\n",
      "woman alone could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34\n",
      "particularly in view of the fact that the nature of the injuries (gandasa blows with a\n",
      "heavy hand) made it explicit that they were the handiwork of masculine power and not\n",
      "that of feminine hands.198. It is also necessary to remember that mere presence of the\n",
      "offender at the scene of murder without any participation to facilitate the offence is not\n",
      "enough.199. By merely accompanying the accused one does not become liable for the\n",
      "crime committed by the accused within the meaning of section 34, IPC, 1860.200. The\n",
      "degree of participation is also an important factor.201. The court restated the two\n",
      "ingredients for application of the section which are:\n",
      "(i) common intention to commit a crime, and\n",
      "(ii) participation by all the accused in the act or acts in furtherance of the common\n",
      "intention. These two things establish their joint liability.202.\n",
      "Where one of the accused persons focussed light on the victim with a torch so as to\n",
      "enable others to assault him, otherwise it is a dark night. The court said that his\n",
      "conduct prior and subsequent to the occurrence clearly showed that he shared the\n",
      "common intention so far as the assault on the deceased was concerned. Hence, he\n",
      "was rightly roped in under section 34.203. If participation is proved and common\n",
      "intention is absent, section 34 cannot be invoked.204. The co-accused was standing\n",
      "outside the house, where the incident took place, while the others committed the\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "murder. There is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime. He did not even\n",
      "act as a guard; he did not prevent the witness from entering the house. There is no\n",
      "evidence of the formation or sharing of any common intention with the other accused.\n",
      "No weapon was seized from him, nor was any property connected with the crime,\n",
      "conﬁscated from him. It was therefore, held that, it was not safe to convict the co-\n",
      "accused of the offence of murder with the aid of sub-sections 34 and 120(B).205.\n",
      "[s 34.8] Physical Presence not sine qua non.—\n",
      "Physical presence at the very spot is not always a necessary ingredient to attract the\n",
      "action. The Supreme Court decision in Shreekantiah Ramayya v State of Bombay,206. is\n",
      "the authority for the aforesaid proposition. Vivian Bose, J, speaking for the Bench of\n",
      "three Judges stated thus:\n",
      "He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate\n",
      "outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a\n",
      "nearby road ready to facilitate their escape.\n",
      "What is required is his actual participation in the commission of the offence in some\n",
      "way or other at the time when the crime is actually being committed. The participation\n",
      "need not in all cases be by physical presence. In offence involving physical violence,\n",
      "normally presence at the scene of offence may be necessary, but such is not the case\n",
      "in respect of other offences when the offence consists of diverse acts which may be\n",
      "done at different times and places. The physical presence at the scene of offence of\n",
      "the offender sough to be rendered liable under this section is not one of the conditions\n",
      "of its applicability in every case.207. Even the concept of presence of the co-accused at\n",
      "the scene is not a necessary requirement to attract section 34 of the IPC, 1860, e.g., the\n",
      "co-accused can remain a little away and supply weapons to the participating accused\n",
      "either by throwing or by catapulting them so that the participating accused can inﬂict\n",
      "injuries on the targeted person. There may be other provisions in the IPC, 1860 like sub-\n",
      "sections 120B or 109 which could be invoked then to catch such non-participating\n",
      "accused. Thus, participation in the crime in furtherance of the common intention is sine\n",
      "qua non for section 34 IPC, 1860. Exhortation to other accused, even guarding the\n",
      "scene etc. would amount to participation. Of course, when the allegation against an\n",
      "accused is that he participated in the crime by oral exhortation or by guarding the\n",
      "scene the court has to evaluate the evidence very carefully for deciding whether that\n",
      "person had really done any such act.208.\n",
      "The absence of any overt act of assault, exhortation or possession of weapon cannot\n",
      "be singularly determinative of absence of common intention.209.\n",
      "[s 34.9] In furtherance of common intention.—\n",
      "The Supreme Court referred to the Oxford English Dictionary where the word\n",
      "\"furtherance\" is deﬁned as an \"action of helping forward.\" Russell, in his book on\n",
      "Criminal Law adopted this deﬁnition and said:\n",
      "It indicates some kind of aid or assistance proceeding an effect in future and that any act\n",
      "may be regarded as done in furtherance of the ultimate felony if it is a step intentionally\n",
      "taken for the purpose of effecting the felony.\" The Supreme Court has also construed the\n",
      "word \"furtherance\" as \"advancement or promotion.210.\n",
      "1. 'Common intention'.—The phrase 'common intention' means a pre-oriented plan and\n",
      "acting in pursuance to the plan. The common intention to give effect to a particular act\n",
      "may even develop at the spur of moment between a number of persons with reference\n",
      "to the facts of a given case.211. In Amrik Singh's case it has further been held that\n",
      "though common intention may develop in course of the ﬁght but there must be clear\n",
      "and unimpeachable evidence to justify that inference.212. Before a Court can convict a\n",
      "person for any offence read with section 34, it should come to a deﬁnite conclusion\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "that the said person had a prior concert with one or more other persons, named or\n",
      "unnamed, for committing the said offence.213. Where the act of murder by the main\n",
      "accused was facilitated by two others by catching hold of the victim but without\n",
      "knowing nor having the intention of causing death, it was held that the only common\n",
      "intention that could be inferred was that of causing grievous hurt.214. Where the\n",
      "accused had inﬂicted lathi blows causing injuries only on the eyewitness and not on the\n",
      "deceased, he could not be said to have shared the common intention of committing\n",

      "Common intention does not mean similar intention of several persons. To constitute\n",

Such a declaration\\nwas made as long back as in 1898. By an amendment in 2009 to the said section, the\\nCode is extended to any person in any place \"without and beyond the territory of India\",\\ncommitting an offence targeting a computer resource located in India.13.\\nnation, rank, caste or creed, provided the offence with which he is charged has been\\ncommitted in some part of India. A foreigner who enters the Indian territories and thus,\\naccepts the protection of Indian laws virtually gives an assurance of his ﬁdelity and\\nobedience to them and submits himself to their operation. It is no defence on behalf of\\na foreigner that he did not know he was doing wrong, the act not being an offence in\\nhis own country. A foreigner who commits an offence within India is guilty and can be\\npunished as such without any limitation as to his corporal presence in India at the\\ntime.14. Indian Courts have jurisdiction against foreigners residing in foreign countries\\nbut their acts connected with transaction or part of transaction arising in India.15.'), ('2.1', 'Corporate Criminal Liability\\nA company is liable to be prosecuted and punished for criminal offences. Although\\nthere are earlier authorities to the fact that the corporation cannot commit a crime, the\\ngenerally accepted modern rule is that a corporation may be subject to indictment and\\nother criminal process although the criminal act may be committed through its agent.\\nThe majority in the Constitution bench held that there is no immunity to the companies\\nfrom prosecution merely because the prosecution is in respect of offences for which\\nthe punishment is mandatory imprisonment and ﬁne.16. When imprisonment and ﬁne is\\nprescribed as punishment the Court can impose the punishment of ﬁne which could be\\nenforced against the company.17.\\nIn CBI v Blue Sky Tie-up Pvt Ltd,18. the question again came up for consideration before\\nthe Supreme Court and it was held that since the majority of the Constitution Bench\\nruled in Standard Chartered Bank v Directorate of Enforcement [supra] that the company\\ncan be prosecuted even in a case where the Court can impose substantive sentence as\\nalso ﬁne, and in such case only ﬁne can be imposed on the corporate body, the contrary\\nview taken by the learned single Judge cannot be approved.'), ('2.2', 'Vicarious Liability.—\\nIndian Penal Code, save and except some matters does not contemplate any vicarious\\nliability on the part of a person. Commission of an offence by raising a legal ﬁction or\\nby creating a vicarious liability in terms of the provisions of a statute must be expressly\\nstated. The Managing Director or the Directors of the Company, thus, cannot be said to\\nhave committed an offence only because they are holders of oﬃces.19. Vicarious\\nliability of the Managing Director and Director would arise provided any provision exists\\nin that behalf in the statute. Statutes indisputably must contain provision ﬁxing such\\nvicarious liabilities. Even for the said purpose, it is obligatory on the part of the\\ncomplainant to make requisite allegations which would attract the provisions\\nconstituting vicarious liability.20. The provisions of the Essential Commodities Act,\\n1955, Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, Employees\\' Provident Fund (Miscellaneous\\nProvision) Act, 1952, etc., have created such vicarious liability. It is interesting to note\\nthat section 14A of the 1952 Act speciﬁcally creates an offence of criminal breach of\\ntrust in respect of the amount deducted from the employees by the company. In terms\\nof the explanations appended to section 405 of the IPC, 1860 a legal ﬁction has been\\ncreated to the effect that the employer shall be deemed to have committed an offence\\nof criminal breach of trust. Whereas a person in charge of the affairs of the company\\nand in control thereof has been made vicariously liable for the offence committed by\\nthe company along with the company but even in a case falling under section 406 of\\nthe IPC, 1860 vicarious liability has been held to be not extendable to the Directors or\\noﬃcers of the company.21.\\nThere is no exception in favour of anyone in the Penal Code, but the following persons\\nare exempted from the jurisdiction of criminal Courts of every country:—\\n(a) Foreign Sovereigns.—The real principle on which the exemption, of every sovereign\\nfrom the jurisdiction of every Court, has been deduced is that the exercise of such\\njurisdiction would be incompatible with his regal dignity—that is to say, with his\\nabsolute independence of every superior authority.22.\\n(b) Diplomats.—United Nations Privileges and Immunities Act, 1947, and the Diplomatic\\nRelations (Vienna Convention) Act, 1972, gave certain diplomats, missions and their\\nmember\\'s diplomatic immunity even from criminal jurisdiction. The Diplomatic\\nRelations (Vienna Convention) Act had been enacted to give effect to the Vienna\\nConvention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961. The effect of section 2 of the Act is to give\\nthe force of law in India to certain provisions set out in the Schedule to the Act.\\nA diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving\\nState. He shall also enjoy immunity from its civil and administrative jurisdiction except\\nin the case of:\\n(i) A real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the\\nreceiving State, unless he holds it on behalf of the sending State for the\\npurposes of the mission;\\n(ii) An action relating to succession in which the diplomatic agent is involved as\\nexecutor, administrator, heir or legatee as a private person and not on behalf of\\nthe sending State;\\n(iii) An action relating to any professional or commercial activity exercised by the\\ndiplomatic agent in the receiving State outside his oﬃcial functions.23. A\\ndiplomatic agent is not obliged to give evidence as a witness.24. Privileges and\\nimmunities are conferred on United Nations and its Representatives as well as\\non other international organisations and their representatives by the United\\nNations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, 1947.25.\\n(c) Alien enemies.—In respect of acts of war alien enemies cannot be tried by criminal\\nCourts. If an alien enemy commits a crime unconnected with war, e.g., theft, he would\\nbe triable by ordinary criminal Courts.\\n(d) Foreign army.—When armies of one State are by consent on the soil of a foreign\\nState they are exempted from the jurisdiction of the State on whose soil they are.\\n(e) Warships.—Men-of-war of a State in foreign waters are exempt from the jurisdiction\\nof the State within whose territorial jurisdiction they are. The domestic Courts, in\\naccordance with principles of international law, will accord to the ship and its crew and\\nits contents certain immunities. The immunities can, in any case, be waived by the\\nnation to which the public ship belongs.26.\\n(f) President and Governors.—Under Article 361 of the Indian Constitution, the\\nPresident and Governors are exempt from the jurisdiction of Courts.\\nthe Penal Code, unless it has been made so by means of special provisions such as\\nsections 3, 4, 108A, etc., of the Code. Under section179 of the Cr PC, 1973 even the\\nplace(s) wherein the consequence (of the criminal act) \"ensues\" would be relevant to\\ndetermine the Court of competent jurisdiction. Therefore, even the Courts within whose\\nlocal jurisdiction, the repercussion/effect of the criminal act occurs, would have\\njurisdiction in the matter. When the consequence of an act committed by a foreigner\\noutside India if ensued in India, he can be tried in India.27. Normally crime carries the\\nperson. The commission of a crime gives the Court of the place where it is committed\\njurisdiction over the person of the offender.28.'), ('2.3', \"Territorial jurisdiction.—\\nThe territory of India is deﬁned under Article 1 of the Constitution of India. Article 1 of\\nthe Constitution of India deals only with the geographical territory while Article 297\\ndeals with 'maritime territory'.\\nArticle 297(3) authorises the Parliament to specify from time to time the limits of\\nvarious maritime zones such as, territorial waters, continental shelf, etc. Clauses (1)\\nand (2) of the said Article make a declaration that all lands, minerals and other things\\nof value and all other resources shall vest in the Union of India.29. Section 18 of the IPC,\\n1860 deﬁnes India as the territory of India excluding the state of Jammu and Kashmir.\\nThese territorial limits would include the territorial waters of India.30. Under the General\\nClauses Act, 1897, India is deﬁned to mean all territories for the time being comprised\\nin the territory of India as deﬁned in the Constitution of India. Under the provisions of\\nArticle 297 of the Constitution of India, all lands, minerals and other things of value\\nunderlying the ocean within the territorial waters or the continental shelf or the\\nexclusive economic zone of India vest in the Union. The Constitution of India does not\\nitself deﬁne the terms territorial waters, continental shelf, and exclusive economic\\nzone. Clause (3) of Article 297 states that their limits shall be such as may be speciﬁed\\nby Parliament. In 1976, Parliament implemented the amendments to the Constitution\\nof India by passing the Maritime Zones Act, 1976.31. Insofar the Republic of India is\\nconcerned, the limit of the territorial waters was initially understood to be three nautical\\nmiles. It had been extended subsequently; up to six nautical miles by a Presidential\\nproclamation dated 22 March 1952 and to 12 nautical miles by another proclamation\\ndated 30 September 1967. By The Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive\\nEconomic Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 80 of 1976, it was statutorily ﬁxed at 12\\nnautical miles. Section 3 of the Act stipulates that the sovereignty of India extends to\\nthe territorial waters, the limit of which is 12 nautical miles. Section 5 of the Territorial\\nWaters Act, 1976 deﬁnes the contiguous zone of India as an area beyond and adjacent\\nto territorial waters to a distance of 24 nautical miles from the nearest point of the\\nbaseline. Section 7 of the Act deﬁnes the Exclusive economic zone of India as an area\\nbeyond and adjacent to territorial waters up to a limit of 200 nautical miles.32.\"), ('2.4', 'Jurisdiction beyond Territorial Waters\\nIn the case of British India Steam Navigation Co Ltd v Shanmughavilas Cashew\\nIndustries,33. the Supreme Court examined the effective operation of the statutes of a\\ncountry in relation to foreigners and foreign ships.\\nIn general, a statute extends territorially, unless the contrary is stated, throughout the\\ncountry and will extend to the territorial waters, and such places as intention to that effect is\\nshown.

The\\nwords of this section postulate the existence of a law that an act constituting an\\noffence in India shall also be an offence when committed outside India.

Surrender of a person within the State to\\nanother State—whether a citizen or an alien—is a political act done in pursuance of a\\ntreaty or an arrangement ad hoc.56. Though extradition is granted in implementation of\\nthe international commitment of the State, the procedure to be followed by the Courts\\nin deciding, whether extradition should be granted and on what terms, is determined by\\nthe municipal law of the land. Extradition is founded on the broad principle that it is in\\nthe interest of civilised communities that criminals should not go unpunished and on\\nthat account, it is recognised as a part of the comity of nations that one State should\\nordinarily afford to another State assistance towards bringing offenders to justice.57.\\nThe procedure for securing the extradition from India is laid down in the Extradition Act,\\n(II) Extraterritorial jurisdiction.—Indian Courts are empowered to try offences\\ncommitted out of India on (A) land, (B) high seas or (C) aircraft.\\n(A) Land.—By virtue of sections 3 and 4 of the Penal Code, and section 188 of the Cr\\nPC, 1973 local Courts can take cognizance of offences committed beyond the\\nterritories of India. Where the Court is dealing with an act committed outside India by a\\ncitizen of India which would be an offence punishable under the Penal Code if it had\\nbeen committed in India, section 4 constitutes the act an offence and it can be dealt\\nwith under section 188 of the Cr PC, 1973.58. If, however, at the time of commission of\\nthe offence the accused person is not a citizen of India, the provisions of section 4 of\\nthe Penal Code and section 188 of the Cr PC, 1973 have no application.59.\\nSection 188 of the Cr PC, 1973, provides that when an offence is committed outside\\nIndia—\\n(a) by a citizen of India, whether on high seas or elsewhere; or\\n(b) by any person not being such citizen on any ship or aircraft registered in India,\\nhe may be dealt with in respect of such offence as if it had been committed at\\nany place within India at which he may be found.\\nThe word 'found' in section 188, Cr PC, 1973 means not where a person is discovered\\nbut where he is actually present.60. A man brought to a place against his will can be\\nsaid to be found there.61. When a man is in the country and is charged before a\\nMagistrate with an offence under the Penal Code, it will not avail him to say that he was\\nbrought there illegally from a foreign country. The Bombay High Court has laid down\\nthis principle, following English precedents, in Savarkar's case.62. The accused Savarkar\\nhad escaped at Mareseilles from the custody of police oﬃcers charged with the duty of\\nbringing him from London to Bombay, but was re-arrested there and brought to Bombay\\nand committed for trial by the Special Magistrate at Nasik. The High Court held that the\\ntrial and committal were valid.63. The provisions of the IPC, 1860 have been extended\\nto offences committed by any citizen of India in any place within and beyond India by\\nvirtue of section 4 thereof. Accordingly, offences committed in Botswana by an Indian\\ncitizen would also be amenable to the provisions of the IPC, 1860 subject to the\\nlimitation imposed under the proviso to section 188 Cr PC, 1973.64. Section 4 gives\\nextraterritorial jurisdiction but as the Explanation says the acts committed must\\namount to an offence under the Penal Code.65.\"), ('4.2', 'Acts done within Indian as well as foreign territory.—\\nA person who is a citizen of India is liable to be tried by the Courts of this country for\\nacts done by him, partly within and partly without the Indian territories, provided the\\nacts amount together to an offence under the Code.66.\\n(B) Admiralty jurisdiction.—The jurisdiction to try offences committed on the high seas\\nis known as the admiralty jurisdiction. It is founded on the principle that a ship on the\\nhigh seas is a ﬂoating island belonging to the nation whose ﬂag she is ﬂying.\\nAdmiralty jurisdiction extends over—\\n(1) Offences committed on Indian ships on the high seas.\\n(2) Offences committed on foreign ships in Indian territorial waters.\\n(3) Piracy.\\nPower to enforce claims against foreign ships is an essential attribute of admiralty\\njurisdiction and it is assumed over such ships while they are within the jurisdiction of\\nthe High Court by arresting and detaining them. Admiralty jurisdiction of the High\\nCourts in India has been historically traced to the Charters of 1774 and 1728, as\\nsubsequently expanded and clariﬁed by the Letters Patent of 1823, 1862 and 1865 read\\nwith the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, and the\\nColonial Court of Admiralty (India) Act, 1891 and preserved by section 106 of the\\nGovernment of India Act, 1915, section 223 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and\\nArticle 225 of the Constitution of India. The pre-Constitution enactments have\\ncontinued to remain in force in India as existing laws.67.\\nThe High Court as a Court of Admiralty is treated as a separate entity exercising a\\ndistinct and speciﬁc or prescribed or limited jurisdiction. This reasoning is based on the\\nassumption that the continuance in force of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890\\nas an existing law carves out a distinct jurisdiction of the High Court limited in ambit\\nand eﬃcacy to what has been granted by the Admiralty Court Act 1861, and that\\njurisdiction has remained stultiﬁed ever since. This restrictive construction is not\\nwarranted by the provisions of the Constitution. Accordingly, a foreign ship falls within\\nthe jurisdiction of the High Court where the vessel happens to be at the relevant time,\\ni.e., at the time when the jurisdiction of the High Court is invoked, or, where the cause of\\naction wholly or in part arises. The Merchant Shipping Act empowers the concerned\\nHigh Court to arrest a ship in respect of a substantive right. This jurisdiction can be\\nassumed by the concerned High Court, whether or not the defendant resides or carries\\non business, or the cause of action arose wholly or in part, within the local limits of its\\njurisdiction. Once a foreign ship is arrested within the local limits of the jurisdiction of\\nthe High Court, and the owner of the ship has entered appearance and furnished\\nsecurity to the satisfaction of the High Court for the release of the ship, the\\nproceedings continue as a personal action. The conclusion is that all the High Courts in\\nIndia have inherent admiralty jurisdiction and can invoke the same for the enforcement\\nof a maritime claim.68.\\nEven while exercising extraordinary powers available under the Constitution the\\njurisdiction of the High Court is primarily circumscribed by its territorial limits, viz., the\\njurisdiction has to be in context of the territorial jurisdiction available to the High Court.\\nIf the overall scheme of IPC, 1860 (section 4), Cr PC, 1973 (section 188), The Merchant\\nShipping Act, 1958 (section 437) and the Territorial Waters Act, 1976 (section 13) are\\ntaken into consideration read with sections 2(2) and 3(15) of the Merchant Shipping\\nAct, it is apparent that for a Court, including High Court, to be vested with jurisdiction,\\nan offender or offending vessel have to be found within local territorial limits of such\\nCourt.69.'), ('4.3', 'Piracy\\nPiracy consists of any of the following acts:\\n(a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for\\nprivate ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft,\\nand directed:\\n(i) on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or\\nproperty on board such ship or aircraft;\\n(ii) against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the\\njurisdiction of any State;\\n(b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with\\nknowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;\\n(c) any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in\\nsubparagraph (a) or (b).70.\\nThe Convention on the Law of Sea known as United National Convention on the Law of\\nSea, 1982 (UNCLOS) sets out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and\\narmed robbery at sea, as well as other ocean activities. UNCLOS, 1982 is a\\ncomprehensive code on the international law of sea. It codiﬁes and consolidates the\\ntraditional law within a single, uniﬁcatory legal framework. It has changed the legal\\nconcept of continental shelf and also introduced a new maritime zone known as\\nexclusive economic zone. Exclusive economic zone is a new concept having several\\nnew features.71. The UNCLOS signed by India in 1982 and ratiﬁed on 29 June 1995,\\nencapsulates the law of the sea and is supplemented by several subsequent\\nresolutions adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations.\\nBefore UNCLOS came into existence, the law relating to the seas which was in\\noperation in India, was the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic\\nZone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 1976, which spelt out the jurisdiction of the\\nCentral Government over the Territorial Waters, the Contiguous Zones and the\\nExclusive Economic Zone. The provisions of the UNCLOS are in harmony with and not\\nin conﬂict with the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, in this regard. Article 33\\nof the Convention recognises and describes the Contiguous Zone of a nation to extend\\nto 24 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is\\nmeasured. Similarly, Articles 56 and 57 describe the rights, jurisdiction and duties of\\nthe coastal State in the Exclusive Economic Zone and the breadth thereof extending to\\n20 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is\\nmeasured. This provision is also in consonance with the provisions of the 1976 Act.\\nThe area of difference between the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, and the\\nConvention occurs in Article 97 of the Convention which relates to the penal\\njurisdiction in matters of collision or any other incident of navigation.72.'), ('4.4', 'Jurisdiction of Indian High Courts.—\\nIn view of the declaration of law made by the Supreme Court in M V Elisabeth v Harwan\\nInvestment and Trading,73. the High Courts in India have inherent admiralty jurisdiction.\\nThe offences which come within the admiralty jurisdiction are now deﬁned by the\\nMerchant Shipping Act, 1958.\\n(C) Aircraft.—The provisions of the Code are made applicable to any offence\\ncommitted by any person on any aircraft registered in India, wherever it may be.'), ('4.5', 'Liability of foreigners in India for offences committed outside its limits.\\n—\\nThe acts of a foreigner committed by him in territory beyond the limits of India do not\\nconstitute an offence against the Penal Code, and, consequently, a foreigner cannot be\\nheld criminally responsible under that Code by the tribunals of India for acts committed\\nby him beyond its territorial limits.

Thus, the personnel of the Army, Navy and Airforce are\\ngoverned by the provisions of the Army Act, 1950, The Navy Act, 1957, and The Indian\\nAir Force Act, 1950 in regard to offences of mutiny and desertion committed by\\nthem.79.\\nwhereas a local law is a law which applies only to a particular part of the country.81.\\nThe distinction between a statute creating a new offence with a particular penalty and\\na statute enlarging the ambit of an existing offence by including new acts within it with\\na particular penalty is well settled. In the former case the new offence is punishable by\\nthe new penalty only; in the latter it is punishable also by all such penalties as were\\napplicable before the Act to the offence in which it is included. The Principle is that\\nwhere a new offence is created and the particular manner in which proceedings should\\nbe taken is laid down, then proceedings cannot be taken in any other way.82.

The prior special law will continue to apply and prevail in spite of\\nthe subsequent general law. But where a clear intention to make a rule of\\nuniversal application by superseding the earlier special law is evident from the\\nlater general law, then the later general law, will prevail over the prior special law.\\n(iv) Where a later special law is repugnant to or inconsistent with an earlier general\\nlaw, the later special law will prevail over the earlier general law.\\n[Maya Mathew v State of Kerala86. and P Raghava Kurup v V Ananthakumari87..]'), ('5.1', 'Contempt of Court\\nContempt of Courts Act, 1971 (Act 70 of 1971) makes it clear that, Contempt of Court\\nmeans \\'Civil contempt\\' or \\'Criminal contempt\\'.88. \\'Civil contempt\\' means wilful\\ndisobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a Court\\nor wilful breach of an Undertaking given to a Court.89. \"Criminal contempt\" means the\\npublication (whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible\\nrepresentations, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever\\nwhich – (i) scandalises or tends to scandalise or lowers or tends to lower the authority\\nof any Court; or (ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of\\nany judicial proceeding; or (iii) interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends\\nto obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner.90.

The gain or loss contemplated need not be a total acquisition or a total\\ndeprivation but it is enough if it is a temporary retention of property by the person\\nwrongfully gaining or a temporary \"keeping out\" of property from the person legally\\nentitled.109.

      "[('25', '\"Fraudulently.\".\\nA person is said to do a thing fraudulently if he does that thing with intent to defraud 1\\nbut not otherwise.\\nCOMMENT—\\nThe intention with which an act is done is very important in determining whether the\\nact is done \\'dishonestly\\' or \\'fraudulently\\'.\\nThe word \\'defraud\\' is of double meaning in the sense that it either may or may not imply\\ndeprivation, and, as it is not deﬁned, its meaning must be sought by a consideration of\\nthe context in which the word \\'fraudulently\\' is found.126.\\nFraud is an act of deliberate deception with a design to secure something, which is\\notherwise not due. Fraud and deception are synonymous.127.\\nTo \\'defraud\\' or do something fraudulently is not by itself made an offence under the\\nPenal Code, but various acts when done fraudulently (or fraudulently and dishonestly)\\nare made offences. These include:\\n(i) Fraudulent removal or concealment of property (sections 206, 421, 424)\\n(ii) Fraudulent claim to property to prevent seizure (section 207).\\n(iii) Fraudulent suffering or obtaining a decree (sections 208 and 210)\\n(iv) Fraudulent possession/delivery of counterfeit coin (sections 239, 240, 242 and\\n243).\\n(v) Fraudulent alteration/diminishing weight of coin (sections 246–253)\\n(vi) Fraudulent acts relating to stamps (sections 261–261)\\n(vii) Fraudulent use of false instruments/weight/measure (sections 264–266)\\n(viii) Cheating (sections 415–420)\\n(ix) Fraudulent prevention of debt being available to creditors (section 422).\\n(x) Fraudulent execution of deed of transfer containing false statement of\\nconsideration (section 423).\\n(xi) Forgery making or executing a false document (sections 463–471 and 474)\\n(xii) Fraudulent cancellation/destruction of valuable security, etc. (section 477)\\n(xiii) Fraudulently going through marriage ceremony (section 496).\\nIt follows therefore, that by merely alleging or showing that a person acted fraudulently,\\nit cannot be assumed that he committed an offence punishable under the Code or any\\nother law, unless that fraudulent act is speciﬁed to be an offence under the Code or\\nother law.128.\\nThe expression \\'defraud\\' involves two elements, namely, deceit and injury to the person\\ndeceived. The injury may even comprise a non-economic or non-pecuniary loss. Even in\\nthose rare cases where the beneﬁt to the deceiver does not cause corresponding loss\\nto the deceived, the second condition is satisﬁed.129. The expression \"intent to deceive\"\\nis different from the expression \"intent to defraud\".130. \"Intent to defraud\" is established\\nonly when the deception has as its aim some advantage or the likelihood of advantage\\nto the person who causes the deceit or some kind of injury or the possibility of injury to\\nanother.131. Thus, where an expert deposing before a court as a defence witness was\\nasked to produce his credentials before the court and it appeared from the documents\\nproduced that they were not genuine, it was held that as he acted under the orders of\\nthe court and not voluntarily, it could not be said that his intention was to cause any\\none to act to his disadvantage. In the circumstances, he did not act with \"intent to\\ndefraud\". He was, therefore, held liable under sections 193 and 196 but not under\\nsections 465 and 471, IPC, 1860.132.'), ('25.1', '\\'Fraudulently\\'; \\'dishonestly\\'.—\\nAccording to the Supreme Court \"the word \"defraud\" includes an element of deceit.\\nDeceit is not an ingredient of the deﬁnition of the word \"dishonestly\" while it is an\\nimportant ingredient of the deﬁnition of the word \"fraudulently\". The former involves a\\npecuniary or economic gain or loss while the latter by construction excludes that\\nelement. Further, the juxtaposition of the two expressions \"dishonestly\" and\\n\"fraudulently\" used in the various sections of the Code indicate their close aﬃnity and\\ntherefore, the deﬁnition of one may give colour to the other. To illustrate, in the\\ndeﬁnition of \"dishonestly\", wrongful gain or wrongful loss is the necessary ingredient.\\nBoth need not exist, one would be enough. So too, if the expression \"fraudulently\" were\\nto be held to involve the element of injury to the person or persons deceived, it would\\nbe reasonable to assume that the injury should be something other than pecuniary or\\neconomic loss. Though almost always an advantage to one causes loss to another and\\nvice versa, it need not necessarily be so.\"133.\\nWhere the accused, after the execution and registration of a document, which was not\\nrequired by law to be attested, added his name to the document as an attesting\\nwitness, it was held that his act was neither fraudulent nor dishonest and the accused\\nwas, therefore, not guilty of forgery.134.

The soul of\\nsection 34, IPC, 1860 is the joint liability in doing a criminal act.172.'), ('34.1', 'History.—\\nSection 34 IPC, 1860 is part of the original Code of 1860 as drafted by Lord Macaulay.\\nThe original section as it stood was \"When a criminal act is done by several persons,\\neach of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by\\nhim alone.\" However, on account of certain observations made by Sir Barnes Peacock,\\nCJ, in Queen v Gora Chand Gope,173. it was necessary to bring about a change in the\\nwordings of the section. Accordingly, in the year 1870 an amendment was brought\\nwhich introduced the following words after \"when a criminal act is done by several\\npersons...\" \"…in furtherance of the common intention...\". After this change, the section\\nhas not been changed or amended ever.'), ('34.2', \"Object.—\\nThe provision is intended to meet a case in which it may be diﬃcult to distinguish\\nbetween acts of individual members of a party who act in furtherance of the common\\nintention of all or to prove exactly what part was taken by each of them. The true\\ncontents of the section are that if two or more persons intentionally do an act jointly,\\nthe position in law is just the same as if each of them has done it individually by\\nhimself. As observed in Ashok Kumar v State of Punjab,174. the existence of a common\\nintention amongst the participants in a crime is the essential element for application of\\nthis section. It is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with\\ncommission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar. The acts may\\nbe different in character, but must have been actuated by one and the same common\\nintention in order to attract the provision.175. Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,176.\\nstated the true purport of section 34 as:\\nThe words of s.34 are not to be eviscerated by reading them in this exceedingly limited\\nsense. By s.33 a criminal act in s.34 includes a series of acts and, further, 'act' includes\\nomission to act, for example, an omission to interfere in order to prevent a murder being\\ndone before one's very eyes. By s.37, when any offence is committed by means of several\\nacts whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one\\nof those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Even if the\\nappellant did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as\\nin other things 'they also serve who only stand and wait'.177.\"), ('34.3', 'Principle.—\\nThis section is only a rule of evidence and does not create a substantive offence.\\nSection 34 IPC, 1860 lays down the principle of constructive liability. The essence of\\nsection 34 IPC, 1860 is a simultaneous consensus of the minds of the persons\\nparticipating in criminal action to bring about a particular result. Section 34 IPC, 1860\\nstipulates that the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention. In\\nfact, the section is intended to cover a case where a number of persons act together\\nand on the facts of the case it is not possible for the prosecution to prove as to which\\nof the persons who acted together actually committed the crime. Little or no distinction\\nexists between a charge for an offence under a particular section and a charge under\\nthat section read with section 34.178. Therefore, section 34, IPC, 1860, would apply\\neven if no charge is framed under that section provided of course from the evidence it\\nbecomes clear that there was pre-arranged plan to achieve the commonly intended\\nobject.179. Thus, where six persons were charged under sections 148, 302/149 and\\n307/149, IPC, 1860, but two were acquitted, the remaining four accused could be\\nconvicted on the charges of murder and attempt to murder with the aid of section 34 of\\nthe Penal Code.180. This section really means that if two or more persons intentionally\\ndo a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually.181. If the\\ncriminal act was a fresh and independent act springing wholly from the mind of the\\ndoer, the others are not liable merely because when it was done they were intending to\\nbe partakers with the doer in a different criminal act.'), ('34.4', 'Scope, ambit and applicability.—\\nSection 34 of the Indian Penal Code recognises the principle of vicarious liability in\\ncriminal jurisprudence. The said principle enshrined under Section 34 of the Code\\nwould be attracted only if one or more than one accused person act conjointly in the\\ncommission of offence with others. It is not necessary that all such persons should be\\nnamed and identiﬁed before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can\\nbe invoked. So long as the evidence brought by the prosecution would disclose that\\none or more accused persons had acted in concert with other persons not named or\\nidentiﬁed, the liability under Section 34 of the Code would still be attracted. Once the\\nother accused stands acquitted in absence of said evidence, the vicarious liability\\nunder section 34 of the Code would not be attracted so as to hold the accused liable\\nfor the offence with the aid of Section 34 of the Code. However, the accused would still\\nbe liable for the offence if the injury or injuries leading to offence can be attributed to\\nhim.182. A bare reading of this section shows that the section could be dissected as\\nfollows:\\n(a) Criminal act is done by several persons;\\n(b) Such act is done in furtherance of the common intention of all; and\\n(c) Each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done\\nby him alone.\\n(d) But, it is not necessary that all such persons should be named and identiﬁed\\nbefore the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be invoked.183.\\nIn other words, these three ingredients would guide the court in determining whether an\\naccused is liable to be convicted with the aid of section 34. While ﬁrst two are the acts\\nwhich are attributable and have to be proved as actions of the accused, the third is the\\nconsequence. Once the criminal act and common intention are proved, then by ﬁction\\nof law, criminal liability of having done that act by each person individually would arise.\\nThe criminal act, according to section 34 IPC, 1860 must be done by several persons.\\nThe emphasis in this part of the section is on the word \"done\".184. The section does not\\nenvisage the separate act by all the accused persons for becoming responsible for the\\nultimate criminal act. If such an interpretation is accepted, the purpose of section 34\\nshall be rendered infructuous.185. Under section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, a pre-\\nconcert in the sense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary to be proved.186. It is a\\nwell settled law that mere presence or association with other members is not per se\\nsuﬃcient to hold each of them criminally liable for the offences committed by the other\\nmembers, unless there is suﬃcient evidence on record to show that one such member\\nalso intends to or knows the likelihood of commission of such an offending act.187.'), ('34.5', 'Three leading Cases.—\\nThe case of Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,188. is a locus classicus and has\\nbeen followed by number of High Courts and the Supreme Court in a large number of\\ncases. In this case, the Judicial Committee dealt with the scope of section 34 dealing\\nwith the acts done in furtherance of the common intention, making all equally liable for\\nthe results of all the acts of others. It was observed that section 34 when it speaks of a\\ncriminal act done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, has\\nregard not to the offence as a whole, but to the criminal act, that is to say, the totality of\\nthe series of acts which result in the offence. In the case of a person assaulted by\\nmany accused, the criminal act is the offence which ﬁnally results, though the\\nachievement of that criminal act may be the result of the action of several persons.\\nIn another celebrated case Mehbub Shah v King-Emperor,189. the court held that:\\nSection 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section\\ndoes not say \"the common intentions of all,\" nor does it say \"an intention common to all.\"\\nUnder the section, the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common\\nintention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such\\nintention. To invoke the aid of s.34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act\\ncomplained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance of the\\ncommon intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any\\none of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. This being the\\nprinciple, it is clear to their Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the\\nsection implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the\\nsection it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-\\narranged plan.\\nApproving the judgments of the Privy Council in Barendra Kumar Ghosh (Barendra\\nKumar Ghosh v King Emperor,190. and Mahbub Shah cases191 a three-Judge Bench of\\nSupreme Court in Pandurang v State of Hyderabad,192. held that to attract the\\napplicability of section 34 of the Code the prosecution is under an obligation to\\nestablish that there existed a common intention which requires a pre-arranged plan\\nbecause before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the\\nact must have been done in furtherance of the common intention of all. The Court had\\nin mind the ultimate act done in furtherance of the common intention'), ('34.6', 'Common intention and mens rea.—\\nUnder section 34, every individual offender is associated with the criminal act which\\nconstitutes the offence both physically as well as mentally i.e. he is a participant not\\nonly in what has been described as a common act but also what is termed as the\\ncommon intention and, therefore, in both these respects his individual role is put into\\nserious jeopardy although this individual role might be a part of a common scheme in\\nwhich others have also joined him and played a role that is similar or different. But\\nreferring to the common intention, it needs to be clariﬁed that the courts must keep in\\nmind the ﬁne distinction between \"common intention\" on the one hand and mens rea as\\nunderstood in criminal jurisprudence on the other. Common intention is not alike or\\nidentical to mens rea. The latter may be coincidental with or collateral to the former but\\nthey are distinct and different.193.'), ('34.7', \"Participation.—\\nParticipation of several persons in some action with the common intention of\\ncommitting a crime is an essential ingredient; once such participation is established,\\nsection 34 is at once attracted.194. Thus, the dominant feature of section 34 is the\\nelement of intention and participation in action. This participation need not in all cases\\nbe by physical presence.195. The Supreme Court has held that it is the essence of the\\nsection that the person must be physically present at the actual commission of the\\ncrime. He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a\\ngate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a\\ncar on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape, but he must be physically present\\nat the scene of the occurrence and must actually participate in the commission of the\\noffence in some way or other at the time crime is actually being committed.196.\\nThe Supreme Court has emphasised that proof of participation by acceptable evidence\\nmay in circumstances be a clue to the common intention and that it would not be fatal\\nto the prosecution case that the culprits had no community of interests.197.\\nSometimes, however, absence of actual participation may serve an important purpose\\nas it happened, for example, where in a love triangle the paramour killed the woman's\\nhusband and she remained sitting with the dead body inside the house without opening\\nthe door. The main accused having been acquitted, the Supreme Court held that the\\nwoman alone could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34\\nparticularly in view of the fact that the nature of the injuries (gandasa blows with a\\nheavy hand) made it explicit that they were the handiwork of masculine power and not\\nthat of feminine hands.198. It is also necessary to remember that mere presence of the\\noffender at the scene of murder without any participation to facilitate the offence is not\\nenough.199. By merely accompanying the accused one does not become liable for the\\ncrime committed by the accused within the meaning of section 34, IPC, 1860.200. The\\ndegree of participation is also an important factor.201. The court restated the two\\ningredients for application of the section which are:\\n(i)\\ncommon intention to commit a crime, and\\n(ii) participation by all the accused in the act or acts in furtherance of the common\\nintention. These two things establish their joint liability.202.\\nWhere one of the accused persons focussed light on the victim with a torch so as to\\nenable others to assault him, otherwise it is a dark night. The court said that his\\nconduct prior and subsequent to the occurrence clearly showed that he shared the\\ncommon intention so far as the assault on the deceased was concerned. Hence, he\\nwas rightly roped in under section 34.203. If participation is proved and common\\nintention is absent, section 34 cannot be invoked.204. The co-accused was standing\\noutside the house, where the incident took place, while the others committed the\\nmurder. There is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime. He did not even\\nact as a guard; he did not prevent the witness from entering the house. There is no\\nevidence of the formation or sharing of any common intention with the other accused.\\nNo weapon was seized from him, nor was any property connected with the crime,\\nconﬁscated from him. It was therefore, held that, it was not safe to convict the co-\\naccused of the offence of murder with the aid of sub-sections 34 and 120(B).205.\"), ('34.8', 'Physical Presence not sine qua non.—\\nPhysical presence at the very spot is not always a necessary ingredient to attract the\\naction. The Supreme Court decision in Shreekantiah Ramayya v State of Bombay,206. is\\nthe authority for the aforesaid proposition. Vivian Bose, J, speaking for the Bench of\\nthree Judges stated thus:\\nHe need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate\\noutside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a\\nnearby road ready to facilitate their escape.\\nWhat is required is his actual participation in the commission of the offence in some\\nway or other at the time when the crime is actually being committed. The participation\\nneed not in all cases be by physical presence. In offence involving physical violence,\\nnormally presence at the scene of offence may be necessary, but such is not the case\\nin respect of other offences when the offence consists of diverse acts which may be\\ndone at different times and places. The physical presence at the scene of offence of\\nthe offender sough to be rendered liable under this section is not one of the conditions\\nof its applicability in every case.207. Even the concept of presence of the co-accused at\\nthe scene is not a necessary requirement to attract section 34 of the IPC, 1860, e.g., the\\nco-accused can remain a little away and supply weapons to the participating accused\\neither by throwing or by catapulting them so that the participating accused can inﬂict\\ninjuries on the targeted person. There may be other provisions in the IPC, 1860 like sub-\\nsections 120B or 109 which could be invoked then to catch such non-participating\\naccused. Thus, participation in the crime in furtherance of the common intention is sine\\nqua non for section 34 IPC, 1860. Exhortation to other accused, even guarding the\\nscene etc. would amount to participation. Of course, when the allegation against an\\naccused is that he participated in the crime by oral exhortation or by guarding the\\nscene the court has to evaluate the evidence very carefully for deciding whether that\\nperson had really done any such act.208.\\nThe absence of any overt act of assault, exhortation or possession of weapon cannot\\nbe singularly determinative of absence of common intention.209.'), ('34.9', 'In furtherance of common intention.—\\nThe Supreme Court referred to the Oxford English Dictionary where the word\\n\"furtherance\" is deﬁned as an \"action of helping forward.\" Russell, in his book on\\nCriminal Law adopted this deﬁnition and said:\\nIt indicates some kind of aid or assistance proceeding an effect in future and that any act\\nmay be regarded as done in furtherance of the ultimate felony if it is a step intentionally\\ntaken for the purpose of effecting the felony.\" The Supreme Court has also construed the\\nword \"furtherance\" as \"advancement or promotion.210.\\nacting in pursuance to the plan. The common intention to give effect to a particular act\\nmay even develop at the spur of moment between a number of persons with reference\\nto the facts of a given case.211. In Amrik Singh\\'s case it has further been held that\\nthough common intention may develop in course of the ﬁght but there must be clear\\nand unimpeachable evidence to justify that inference.212. Before a Court can convict a\\nperson for any offence read with section 34, it should come to a deﬁnite conclusion\\nthat the said person had a prior concert with one or more other persons, named or\\nunnamed, for committing the said offence.213. Where the act of murder by the main\\naccused was facilitated by two others by catching hold of the victim but without\\nknowing nor having the intention of causing death, it was held that the only common\\nintention that could be inferred was that of causing grievous hurt.214. Where the\\naccused had inﬂicted lathi blows causing injuries only on the eyewitness and not on the\\ndeceased, he could not be said to have shared the common intention of committing\\nmurder of the deceased. He was acquitted for the charge of murder and was convicted\\nunder section 325.215.\\nCommon intention does not mean similar intention of several persons. To constitute\\ncommon intention it is necessary that the intention of each one of them be known to\\nthe rest of them and shared by them.216.\\nWhat to speak of similar intention even same intention without sharing each other\\'s\\nintention is not enough for this section.217. In a case like this each will be liable for\\nwhatever injury he caused but none could be vicariously convicted for the act of any of\\nthe others.218. In ﬁne, if common intention cannot be inferred from the evidence of\\nfacts and circumstances of the case, section 34, IPC, 1860, cannot be invoked.219. A\\nparty of farmers was cutting their crop. The deceased took away a portion of the\\nharvested crop. That night when he was returning from a barat 16 persons waited for\\nhim on the way. They came towards him and the convict who was carrying a knife gave\\nhim a stab wound on the neck which proved fatal. The others did not know that he had\\na knife and all of them being with bare hands, it could not be said that they had the\\ncommon intention of causing death. They could as well have thought that after\\nsurrounding the accused he would be called upon to return or pay for the harvest taken\\naway by him.220.A person gifted his land to one of his grandsons. His other son along\\nwith his wife fully armed, the man with a lathi and the woman with a gandasa came to\\nprotest. The man lost control and both grandson and his father intervened to save the\\nsituation but they received lathi blows and died. The woman struck only her brother-in-\\nlaw with the gandasa causing a non-fatal injury. Her husband was convicted for murder\\nbut her punishment was reduced to causing grievous hurt because it appeared that the\\nwhole thing was a spot happening and not a planned affair.221.\\nWhere the genesis of the verbal wrangle between the neighbours was not known, but it\\nappeared to have arisen suddenly, there being no chance for common intention to be\\nformulated, each attacker was held to be punishable for his individual acts.222.\\nWhere common intention was established the mere fact that one of the culprits\\ndistanced himself from the scene could not absolve him from liability.223.\\nIt is not necessary for bringing a case within the scope of section 34 to ﬁnd as to who\\nin fact inﬂicted the fatal blow. A conviction under the section read with the relevant\\nsubstantive provision can be made when the ingredients required by the section are\\nsatisﬁed and it is not necessary to mention the section number in the judgment.224.\\nDeath of two persons was caused by unprovoked ﬁring by appellants who are police\\noﬃcials and grievous gunshot injuries to another person. It was not necessary to\\nassign a speciﬁc role to each individual appellant as the ﬁring at the Car was\\nundoubtedly with a clear intent to annihilate those in it and was resorted to in\\nfurtherance of common intention of all the appellants. The accused were liable to\\nconviction under section 302/34 IPC, 1860.225. The acts of all the accused need not be\\nthe same or identically similar. All that is necessary is that they all must be actuated by\\nthe one and the same common intention. The fact that two of them caused injuries at\\nthe back of their victim and the injury at the head which proved to be fatal was caused\\nby the third person, the two co-accused could not claim to be absolved of liability for\\nmurder.226.\\nIt is not necessary for bringing about the conviction of the co-accused to show that he\\nalso committed an overt act for the achievement of their object. The absence of any\\novert act or possession of weapon cannot be singularly determinative of absence of\\ncommon intention. If common intention by meeting of minds is established in the facts\\nand circumstances of the case there need not be an overt act or possession of weapon\\nrequired, to establish common intention.227.\\nThe accused caught hold of the victim and exhorted the main accused to strike him. On\\nsuch exhortation the main accused inﬂicted a Kirpan wound. The victim died. It was\\nheld that the instigation was only to strike. It could not be said that the accused shared\\nthe intention of the main accused to kill. The conviction was altered from under\\nsections 202/34 to one under section 324.228. The victim woman was murdered by her\\nfather-in-law and brother-in-law. The third person helped them to conceal the dead body\\nto screen them. The conviction of the two accused for murder was upheld but that of\\nthe third one only for concealment of evidence under sections 201/34.229.'), ('34.10', \"Common Intention: How Proved.—\\nThe common intention can be inferred from the circumstances of the case and that the\\nintention can be gathered from the circumstances as they arise even during an\\nincident.230. Common intention is a state of mind. It is not possible to read a person's\\nmind. There can hardly be direct evidence of common intention. The existence or non-\\nexistence of a common intention amongst the accused has to be deciphered\\ncumulatively from their conduct and behaviour in the facts and circumstances of each\\ncase. Events prior to the occurrence as also after, and during the occurrence, are all\\nrelevant to deduce if there existed any common intention. There can be no straight\\njacket formula.231. The Court has to examine the prosecution evidence in regard to\\napplication of section 34 cumulatively and if the ingredients are satisﬁed, the\\nconsequences must follow. It is diﬃcult to state any hard and fast rule which can be\\napplied universally to all cases. It will always depend on the facts and circumstances of\\nthe given case whether the person involved in the commission of the crime with a\\ncommon intention can be held guilty of the main offence committed by them\\ntogether.232. Courts, in most cases, have to infer the intention from the act(s) or\\nconduct of the accused or other relevant circumstances of the case. However, an\\ninference as to the common intention shall not be readily drawn; the criminal liability\\ncan arise only when such inference can be drawn with a certain degree of\\nassurance.233. In most cases it has to be inferred from the act or conduct or other\\nrelevant circumstances of the case in hand.234. This inference can be gathered by the\\nmanner in which the accused arrived on the scene and mounted the attack, the\\ndetermination and concert with which the beating was given or the injuries caused by\\none or some of them, the acts done by others to assist those causing the injuries, the\\nconcerted conduct subsequent to the commission of the offence, for instance all of\\nthem left the scene of the incident together and other acts which all or some may have\\ndone as would help in determining the common intention. In other words, the totality of\\nthe circumstances must be taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion\\nwhether the accused had a common intention to commit an offence of which they\\ncould be convicted.235. Manner of attack shows the common intention of accused.236.\\nThe Supreme Court has reiterated:\\nWe reiterate that for common intention, there could rarely be direct evidence. The ultimate\\ndecision, at any rate would invariably depend upon the inference deducible from the\\ncircumstances of each case. It is settled law that the common intention or the intention of\\nthe individuals concerned in furtherance of the common intention could be proved either\\nfrom direct evidence or by inference from the acts or attending circumstances of the case\\nand conduct of the parties.237.\"), ('34.11', 'Complaint.—\\nIn order to attract section 34 of the IPC, 1860, the complaint must, prima facie, reﬂect a\\ncommon prior concert or planning amongst all the accused.238.'), ('34.12', 'Effect of no charge under section 34.—\\nEven if section 34 has not been included in a charge framed for the offence under\\nsection 302 IPC, 1860 against the accused, a conviction for the offence under section\\n302 with the aid of section 34 is not bad as no prejudice would be caused to him.239.\\nWhere the appellants caused injuries not enough to cause the death but the same were\\ncaused by another, in the absence of a charge under section 34, they were found to be\\nguilty under section 326 of IPC, 1860.240.\\nSections 34, 114 and 149 of the IPC, 1860 provide for criminal liability viewed from\\ndifferent angles as regards actual participants, accessories and men actuated by a\\ncommon object or a common intention; and as explained by ﬁve Judge Constitution\\nBench of in Willie Slavey v The State of MP,241. the charge is a rolled-up one involving\\nthe direct liability and the constructive liability without specifying who are directly liable\\nand who are sought to be made constructively liable.242. But before a court can convict\\na person under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, it should\\ncome to a deﬁnite conclusion that the said person had a prior concert with one or more\\nother persons, named or unnamed, for committing the said offence. A few illustrations\\nwill bring out the impact of section 34 on different situations.\\n(1) A, B, C and D are charged under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian\\nPenal Code, for committing the murder of E. The evidence is directed to establish that\\nthe said four persons have taken part in the murder.\\n(2) A, B, C and D and unnamed others are charged under the said sections. But\\nevidence is adduced to prove that the said persons, along with others, named or\\nunnamed, participated jointly in the commission of that offence.\\n(3) A, B, C and D are charged under the said sections. But the evidence is directed to\\nprove that A, B, C and D, along with 3 others, have jointly committed the offence. As\\nregards the third illustration, a Court is certainly entitled to come to the conclusion that\\none of the named accused is guilty of murder under section 302, read with section 34,\\nof the Indian Penal Code, though the other three named accused are acquitted, if it\\naccepts the evidence that the said accused acted in concert along with persons,\\nnamed or unnamed, other than those acquitted, in the commission of the offence. In\\nthe second illustration the Court can come to the same conclusion and convict one of\\nthe named accused if it is satisﬁed that no prejudice has been caused to the accused\\nby the defect in the charge. But in the ﬁrst illustration the Court certainly can convict\\ntwo or more of the named accused if it accepts the evidence that they acted conjointly\\nin committing the offence. But what is the position if the Court acquits 3 of the 4\\naccused either because it rejects the prosecution evidence or because it gives the\\nbeneﬁt of doubt to the said accused? Can it hold, in the absence of a charge as well as\\nevidence, that though the three accused are acquitted, some other unidentiﬁed persons\\nacted conjointly along with one of the named persons? If the Court could do so, it\\nwould be making out a new case for the prosecution: it would be deciding contrary to\\nthe evidence adduced in the case. A Court cannot obviously make out a case for the\\nprosecution which is not disclosed either in the charge or in regard to which there is no\\nbasis in the evidence. There must be some foundation in the evidence that persons\\nother than those named have taken part in the commission of the offence and if there\\nis such a basis the case will be covered by the third illustration.243.

If the offence committed by a member of an unlawful\\nassembly is in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or\\nsuch as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in\\nprosecution of the common object, all other members of the unlawful assembly\\nwould be guilty of that offence under section 149, IPC, 1860, although they may\\nnot have intended to do it or participated in the actual commission of that\\noffence.246.\\n(iv) Section 34 does not ﬁx a minimum number of persons who must share the\\ncommon intention, whereas section 149, IPC, 1860, requires that there must be\\nat least ﬁve persons who must have the same common object (see also\\ndiscussion under sub-head \"Sections 34 and 149\" under section 149, IPC, 1860,\\ninfra).247.'), ('34.15', 'Effect of conviction or acquittal of one or more or others.—\\nSeveral persons involved in a criminal adventure may be guilty of different offences\\ndepending upon their respective acts.

Similarly, if they are members of\\nan unlawful assembly, an act done by any one in prosecution of the common object or\\nany act which the members knew could happen in such prosecution, every member\\nwould be liable for the act.

A plain reading of section 397 of the IPC,\\n1860 would make it clear that such guilt can be attributed only to that offender who\\nuses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt to any person during course of the\\ncommission of the robbery. The provision postulates that only the individual act of\\naccused will be relevant to attract section 397 of the IPC, 1860.252.

Though all the accused\\nwould be liable for committing the murder of a person by doing an act or acts in\\nfurtherance of the common intention, they would not be liable for the act or acts if they\\nhad the right of private defence to voluntarily cause death of that person. Common\\nintention, therefore, has relevance only to the offence and not to the right of private\\ndefence. What would be an offence by reason of constructive liability would cease to\\nbe one if the act constituting the offence was done in exercise of the right of private\\ndefence.\\nIf the voluntary causing of death is not permissible under the right of private defence\\nunder section 96, then the common intention in regard thereto will lead to the result\\nthat the accused persons must be held guilty by reason of constructive liability under\\nthe relevant section (in this case section 304 Part I IPC, 1860). If, however, the common\\nintention was only to commit an act which was permissible within the conﬁnes of s. 96\\nread with s. 98, then constructive liability under section 34 cannot be said to have been\\naccrued to the accused.

      "[('34', 'Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.\\nWhen a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common\\nintention 1 of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it\\nwere done by him alone.]\\nCOMMENT—\\nIntroduction.—Ordinarily, no man can be held responsible for an independent act and\\nwrong committed by another. However, section 34 of the IPC, 1860 makes an exception\\nto this principle. It lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act.\\nThe essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of common intention,\\nanimating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such\\nintention. It deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or adverse by several\\npersons, if all are done in furtherance of common intention. In such situation, each\\nperson is liable for the result of that as if he had done that act himself.171. The soul of\\nsection 34, IPC, 1860 is the joint liability in doing a criminal act.172.'), ('34.1', 'History.—\\nSection 34 IPC, 1860 is part of the original Code of 1860 as drafted by Lord Macaulay.\\nThe original section as it stood was \"When a criminal act is done by several persons,\\neach of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by\\nhim alone.\" However, on account of certain observations made by Sir Barnes Peacock,\\nCJ, in Queen v Gora Chand Gope,173. it was necessary to bring about a change in the\\nwordings of the section. Accordingly, in the year 1870 an amendment was brought\\nwhich introduced the following words after \"when a criminal act is done by several\\npersons...\" \"…in furtherance of the common intention...\". After this change, the section\\nhas not been changed or amended ever.'), ('34.2', \"Object.—\\nThe provision is intended to meet a case in which it may be diﬃcult to distinguish\\nbetween acts of individual members of a party who act in furtherance of the common\\nintention of all or to prove exactly what part was taken by each of them. The true\\ncontents of the section are that if two or more persons intentionally do an act jointly,\\nthe position in law is just the same as if each of them has done it individually by\\nhimself. As observed in Ashok Kumar v State of Punjab,174. the existence of a common\\nintention amongst the participants in a crime is the essential element for application of\\nthis section. It is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with\\ncommission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar. The acts may\\nbe different in character, but must have been actuated by one and the same common\\nintention in order to attract the provision.175. Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,176.\\nstated the true purport of section 34 as:\\nThe words of s.34 are not to be eviscerated by reading them in this exceedingly limited\\nsense. By s.33 a criminal act in s.34 includes a series of acts and, further, 'act' includes\\nomission to act, for example, an omission to interfere in order to prevent a murder being\\ndone before one's very eyes. By s.37, when any offence is committed by means of several\\nacts whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one\\nof those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Even if the\\nappellant did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as\\nin other things 'they also serve who only stand and wait'.177.\"), ('34.3', 'Principle.—\\nThis section is only a rule of evidence and does not create a substantive offence.\\nSection 34 IPC, 1860 lays down the principle of constructive liability. The essence of\\nsection 34 IPC, 1860 is a simultaneous consensus of the minds of the persons\\nparticipating in criminal action to bring about a particular result. Section 34 IPC, 1860\\nstipulates that the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention. In\\nfact, the section is intended to cover a case where a number of persons act together\\nand on the facts of the case it is not possible for the prosecution to prove as to which\\nof the persons who acted together actually committed the crime. Little or no distinction\\nexists between a charge for an offence under a particular section and a charge under\\nthat section read with section 34.178. Therefore, section 34, IPC, 1860, would apply\\neven if no charge is framed under that section provided of course from the evidence it\\nbecomes clear that there was pre-arranged plan to achieve the commonly intended\\nobject.179. Thus, where six persons were charged under sections 148, 302/149 and\\n307/149, IPC, 1860, but two were acquitted, the remaining four accused could be\\nconvicted on the charges of murder and attempt to murder with the aid of section 34 of\\nthe Penal Code.180. This section really means that if two or more persons intentionally\\ndo a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually.181. If the\\ncriminal act was a fresh and independent act springing wholly from the mind of the\\ndoer, the others are not liable merely because when it was done they were intending to\\nbe partakers with the doer in a different criminal act.'), ('34.4', 'Scope, ambit and applicability.—\\nSection 34 of the Indian Penal Code recognises the principle of vicarious liability in\\ncriminal jurisprudence. The said principle enshrined under Section 34 of the Code\\nwould be attracted only if one or more than one accused person act conjointly in the\\ncommission of offence with others. It is not necessary that all such persons should be\\nnamed and identiﬁed before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can\\nbe invoked. So long as the evidence brought by the prosecution would disclose that\\none or more accused persons had acted in concert with other persons not named or\\nidentiﬁed, the liability under Section 34 of the Code would still be attracted. Once the\\nother accused stands acquitted in absence of said evidence, the vicarious liability\\nunder section 34 of the Code would not be attracted so as to hold the accused liable\\nfor the offence with the aid of Section 34 of the Code. However, the accused would still\\nbe liable for the offence if the injury or injuries leading to offence can be attributed to\\nhim.182. A bare reading of this section shows that the section could be dissected as\\nfollows:\\n(a) Criminal act is done by several persons;\\n(b) Such act is done in furtherance of the common intention of all; and\\n(c) Each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done\\nby him alone.\\n(d) But, it is not necessary that all such persons should be named and identiﬁed\\nbefore the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be invoked.183.\\nIn other words, these three ingredients would guide the court in determining whether an\\naccused is liable to be convicted with the aid of section 34. While ﬁrst two are the acts\\nwhich are attributable and have to be proved as actions of the accused, the third is the\\nconsequence. Once the criminal act and common intention are proved, then by ﬁction\\nof law, criminal liability of having done that act by each person individually would arise.\\nThe criminal act, according to section 34 IPC, 1860 must be done by several persons.\\nThe emphasis in this part of the section is on the word \"done\".184. The section does not\\nenvisage the separate act by all the accused persons for becoming responsible for the\\nultimate criminal act. If such an interpretation is accepted, the purpose of section 34\\nshall be rendered infructuous.185. Under section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, a pre-\\nconcert in the sense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary to be proved.186. It is a\\nwell settled law that mere presence or association with other members is not per se\\nsuﬃcient to hold each of them criminally liable for the offences committed by the other\\nmembers, unless there is suﬃcient evidence on record to show that one such member\\nalso intends to or knows the likelihood of commission of such an offending act.187.'), ('34.5', 'Three leading Cases.—\\nThe case of Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,188. is a locus classicus and has\\nbeen followed by number of High Courts and the Supreme Court in a large number of\\ncases. In this case, the Judicial Committee dealt with the scope of section 34 dealing\\nwith the acts done in furtherance of the common intention, making all equally liable for\\nthe results of all the acts of others. It was observed that section 34 when it speaks of a\\ncriminal act done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, has\\nregard not to the offence as a whole, but to the criminal act, that is to say, the totality of\\nthe series of acts which result in the offence. In the case of a person assaulted by\\nmany accused, the criminal act is the offence which ﬁnally results, though the\\nachievement of that criminal act may be the result of the action of several persons.\\nIn another celebrated case Mehbub Shah v King-Emperor,189. the court held that:\\nSection 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section\\ndoes not say \"the common intentions of all,\" nor does it say \"an intention common to all.\"\\nUnder the section, the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common\\nintention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such\\nintention. To invoke the aid of s.34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act\\ncomplained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance of the\\ncommon intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any\\none of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. This being the\\nprinciple, it is clear to their Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the\\nsection implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the\\nsection it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-\\narranged plan.\\nApproving the judgments of the Privy Council in Barendra Kumar Ghosh (Barendra\\nKumar Ghosh v King Emperor,190. and Mahbub Shah cases191 a three-Judge Bench of\\nSupreme Court in Pandurang v State of Hyderabad,192. held that to attract the\\napplicability of section 34 of the Code the prosecution is under an obligation to\\nestablish that there existed a common intention which requires a pre-arranged plan\\nbecause before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the\\nact must have been done in furtherance of the common intention of all. The Court had\\nin mind the ultimate act done in furtherance of the common intention'), ('34.6', 'Common intention and mens rea.—\\nUnder section 34, every individual offender is associated with the criminal act which\\nconstitutes the offence both physically as well as mentally i.e. he is a participant not\\nonly in what has been described as a common act but also what is termed as the\\ncommon intention and, therefore, in both these respects his individual role is put into\\nserious jeopardy although this individual role might be a part of a common scheme in\\nwhich others have also joined him and played a role that is similar or different. But\\nreferring to the common intention, it needs to be clariﬁed that the courts must keep in\\nmind the ﬁne distinction between \"common intention\" on the one hand and mens rea as\\nunderstood in criminal jurisprudence on the other. Common intention is not alike or\\nidentical to mens rea. The latter may be coincidental with or collateral to the former but\\nthey are distinct and different.193.'), ('34.7', \"Participation.—\\nParticipation of several persons in some action with the common intention of\\ncommitting a crime is an essential ingredient; once such participation is established,\\nsection 34 is at once attracted.194. Thus, the dominant feature of section 34 is the\\nelement of intention and participation in action. This participation need not in all cases\\nbe by physical presence.195. The Supreme Court has held that it is the essence of the\\nsection that the person must be physically present at the actual commission of the\\ncrime. He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a\\ngate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a\\ncar on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape, but he must be physically present\\nat the scene of the occurrence and must actually participate in the commission of the\\noffence in some way or other at the time crime is actually being committed.196.\\nThe Supreme Court has emphasised that proof of participation by acceptable evidence\\nmay in circumstances be a clue to the common intention and that it would not be fatal\\nto the prosecution case that the culprits had no community of interests.197.\\nSometimes, however, absence of actual participation may serve an important purpose\\nas it happened, for example, where in a love triangle the paramour killed the woman's\\nhusband and she remained sitting with the dead body inside the house without opening\\nthe door. The main accused having been acquitted, the Supreme Court held that the\\nwoman alone could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34\\nparticularly in view of the fact that the nature of the injuries (gandasa blows with a\\nheavy hand) made it explicit that they were the handiwork of masculine power and not\\nthat of feminine hands.198. It is also necessary to remember that mere presence of the\\noffender at the scene of murder without any participation to facilitate the offence is not\\nenough.199. By merely accompanying the accused one does not become liable for the\\ncrime committed by the accused within the meaning of section 34, IPC, 1860.200. The\\ndegree of participation is also an important factor.201. The court restated the two\\ningredients for application of the section which are:\\n(i) common intention to commit a crime, and\\n(ii) participation by all the accused in the act or acts in furtherance of the common\\nintention. These two things establish their joint liability.202.\\nWhere one of the accused persons focussed light on the victim with a torch so as to\\nenable others to assault him, otherwise it is a dark night. The court said that his\\nconduct prior and subsequent to the occurrence clearly showed that he shared the\\ncommon intention so far as the assault on the deceased was concerned. Hence, he\\nwas rightly roped in under section 34.203. If participation is proved and common\\nintention is absent, section 34 cannot be invoked.204. The co-accused was standing\\noutside the house, where the incident took place, while the others committed the\\nmurder. There is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime. He did not even\\nact as a guard; he did not prevent the witness from entering the house. There is no\\nevidence of the formation or sharing of any common intention with the other accused.\\nNo weapon was seized from him, nor was any property connected with the crime,\\nconﬁscated from him. It was therefore, held that, it was not safe to convict the co-\\naccused of the offence of murder with the aid of sub-sections 34 and 120(B).205.\"), ('34.8', 'Physical Presence not sine qua non.—\\nPhysical presence at the very spot is not always a necessary ingredient to attract the\\naction. The Supreme Court decision in Shreekantiah Ramayya v State of Bombay,206. is\\nthe authority for the aforesaid proposition. Vivian Bose, J, speaking for the Bench of\\nthree Judges stated thus:\\nHe need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate\\noutside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a\\nnearby road ready to facilitate their escape.\\nWhat is required is his actual participation in the commission of the offence in some\\nway or other at the time when the crime is actually being committed. The participation\\nneed not in all cases be by physical presence. In offence involving physical violence,\\nnormally presence at the scene of offence may be necessary, but such is not the case\\nin respect of other offences when the offence consists of diverse acts which may be\\ndone at different times and places. The physical presence at the scene of offence of\\nthe offender sough to be rendered liable under this section is not one of the conditions\\nof its applicability in every case.207. Even the concept of presence of the co-accused at\\nthe scene is not a necessary requirement to attract section 34 of the IPC, 1860, e.g., the\\nco-accused can remain a little away and supply weapons to the participating accused\\neither by throwing or by catapulting them so that the participating accused can inﬂict\\ninjuries on the targeted person. There may be other provisions in the IPC, 1860 like sub-\\nsections 120B or 109 which could be invoked then to catch such non-participating\\naccused. Thus, participation in the crime in furtherance of the common intention is sine\\nqua non for section 34 IPC, 1860. Exhortation to other accused, even guarding the\\nscene etc. would amount to participation. Of course, when the allegation against an\\naccused is that he participated in the crime by oral exhortation or by guarding the\\nscene the court has to evaluate the evidence very carefully for deciding whether that\\nperson had really done any such act.208.\\nThe absence of any overt act of assault, exhortation or possession of weapon cannot\\nbe singularly determinative of absence of common intention.209.'), ('34.9', 'In furtherance of common intention.—\\nThe Supreme Court referred to the Oxford English Dictionary where the word\\n\"furtherance\" is deﬁned as an \"action of helping forward.\" Russell, in his book on\\nCriminal Law adopted this deﬁnition and said:\\nIt indicates some kind of aid or assistance proceeding an effect in future and that any act\\nmay be regarded as done in furtherance of the ultimate felony if it is a step intentionally\\ntaken for the purpose of effecting the felony.\" The Supreme Court has also construed the\\nword \"furtherance\" as \"advancement or promotion.210.\\nacting in pursuance to the plan. The common intention to give effect to a particular act\\nmay even develop at the spur of moment between a number of persons with reference\\nto the facts of a given case.211. In Amrik Singh\\'s case it has further been held that\\nthough common intention may develop in course of the ﬁght but there must be clear\\nand unimpeachable evidence to justify that inference.212. Before a Court can convict a\\nperson for any offence read with section 34, it should come to a deﬁnite conclusion\\nthat the said person had a prior concert with one or more other persons, named or\\nunnamed, for committing the said offence.213. Where the act of murder by the main\\naccused was facilitated by two others by catching hold of the victim but without\\nknowing nor having the intention of causing death, it was held that the only common\\nintention that could be inferred was that of causing grievous hurt.214. Where the\\naccused had inﬂicted lathi blows causing injuries only on the eyewitness and not on the\\ndeceased, he could not be said to have shared the common intention of committing\\nmurder of the deceased. He was acquitted for the charge of murder and was convicted\\nunder section 325.215.\\nCommon intention does not mean similar intention of several persons. To constitute\\ncommon intention it is necessary that the intention of each one of them be known to\\nthe rest of them and shared by them.216.\\nWhat to speak of similar intention even same intention without sharing each other\\'s\\nintention is not enough for this section.217. In a case like this each will be liable for\\nwhatever injury he caused but none could be vicariously convicted for the act of any of\\nthe others.218. In ﬁne, if common intention cannot be inferred from the evidence of\\nfacts and circumstances of the case, section 34, IPC, 1860, cannot be invoked.219. A\\nparty of farmers was cutting their crop. The deceased took away a portion of the\\nharvested crop. That night when he was returning from a barat 16 persons waited for\\nhim on the way. They came towards him and the convict who was carrying a knife gave\\nhim a stab wound on the neck which proved fatal. The others did not know that he had\\na knife and all of them being with bare hands, it could not be said that they had the\\ncommon intention of causing death. They could as well have thought that after\\nsurrounding the accused he would be called upon to return or pay for the harvest taken\\naway by him.220.A person gifted his land to one of his grandsons. His other son along\\nwith his wife fully armed, the man with a lathi and the woman with a gandasa came to\\nprotest. The man lost control and both grandson and his father intervened to save the\\nsituation but they received lathi blows and died. The woman struck only her brother-in-\\nlaw with the gandasa causing a non-fatal injury. Her husband was convicted for murder\\nbut her punishment was reduced to causing grievous hurt because it appeared that the\\nwhole thing was a spot happening and not a planned affair.221.\\nWhere the genesis of the verbal wrangle between the neighbours was not known, but it\\nappeared to have arisen suddenly, there being no chance for common intention to be\\nformulated, each attacker was held to be punishable for his individual acts.222.\\nWhere common intention was established the mere fact that one of the culprits\\ndistanced himself from the scene could not absolve him from liability.223.\\nIt is not necessary for bringing a case within the scope of section 34 to ﬁnd as to who\\nin fact inﬂicted the fatal blow. A conviction under the section read with the relevant\\nsubstantive provision can be made when the ingredients required by the section are\\nsatisﬁed and it is not necessary to mention the section number in the judgment.224.\\nDeath of two persons was caused by unprovoked ﬁring by appellants who are police\\noﬃcials and grievous gunshot injuries to another person. It was not necessary to\\nassign a speciﬁc role to each individual appellant as the ﬁring at the Car was\\nundoubtedly with a clear intent to annihilate those in it and was resorted to in\\nfurtherance of common intention of all the appellants. The accused were liable to\\nconviction under section 302/34 IPC, 1860.225. The acts of all the accused need not be\\nthe same or identically similar. All that is necessary is that they all must be actuated by\\nthe one and the same common intention. The fact that two of them caused injuries at\\nthe back of their victim and the injury at the head which proved to be fatal was caused\\nby the third person, the two co-accused could not claim to be absolved of liability for\\nmurder.226.\\nIt is not necessary for bringing about the conviction of the co-accused to show that he\\nalso committed an overt act for the achievement of their object. The absence of any\\novert act or possession of weapon cannot be singularly determinative of absence of\\ncommon intention. If common intention by meeting of minds is established in the facts\\nand circumstances of the case there need not be an overt act or possession of weapon\\nrequired, to establish common intention.227.\\nThe accused caught hold of the victim and exhorted the main accused to strike him. On\\nsuch exhortation the main accused inﬂicted a Kirpan wound. The victim died. It was\\nheld that the instigation was only to strike. It could not be said that the accused shared\\nthe intention of the main accused to kill. The conviction was altered from under\\nsections 202/34 to one under section 324.228. The victim woman was murdered by her\\nfather-in-law and brother-in-law. The third person helped them to conceal the dead body\\nto screen them. The conviction of the two accused for murder was upheld but that of\\nthe third one only for concealment of evidence under sections 201/34.229.'), ('34.10', \"Common Intention: How Proved.—\\nThe common intention can be inferred from the circumstances of the case and that the\\nintention can be gathered from the circumstances as they arise even during an\\nincident.230. Common intention is a state of mind. It is not possible to read a person's\\nmind. There can hardly be direct evidence of common intention. The existence or non-\\nexistence of a common intention amongst the accused has to be deciphered\\ncumulatively from their conduct and behaviour in the facts and circumstances of each\\ncase. Events prior to the occurrence as also after, and during the occurrence, are all\\nrelevant to deduce if there existed any common intention. There can be no straight\\njacket formula.231. The Court has to examine the prosecution evidence in regard to\\napplication of section 34 cumulatively and if the ingredients are satisﬁed, the\\nconsequences must follow. It is diﬃcult to state any hard and fast rule which can be\\napplied universally to all cases. It will always depend on the facts and circumstances of\\nthe given case whether the person involved in the commission of the crime with a\\ncommon intention can be held guilty of the main offence committed by them\\ntogether.232. Courts, in most cases, have to infer the intention from the act(s) or\\nconduct of the accused or other relevant circumstances of the case. However, an\\ninference as to the common intention shall not be readily drawn; the criminal liability\\ncan arise only when such inference can be drawn with a certain degree of\\nassurance.233. In most cases it has to be inferred from the act or conduct or other\\nrelevant circumstances of the case in hand.234. This inference can be gathered by the\\nmanner in which the accused arrived on the scene and mounted the attack, the\\ndetermination and concert with which the beating was given or the injuries caused by\\none or some of them, the acts done by others to assist those causing the injuries, the\\nconcerted conduct subsequent to the commission of the offence, for instance all of\\nthem left the scene of the incident together and other acts which all or some may have\\ndone as would help in determining the common intention. In other words, the totality of\\nthe circumstances must be taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion\\nwhether the accused had a common intention to commit an offence of which they\\ncould be convicted.235. Manner of attack shows the common intention of accused.236.\\nThe Supreme Court has reiterated:\\nWe reiterate that for common intention, there could rarely be direct evidence. The ultimate\\ndecision, at any rate would invariably depend upon the inference deducible from the\\ncircumstances of each case. It is settled law that the common intention or the intention of\\nthe individuals concerned in furtherance of the common intention could be proved either\\nfrom direct evidence or by inference from the acts or attending circumstances of the case\\nand conduct of the parties.237.\"), ('34.11', 'Complaint.—\\nIn order to attract section 34 of the IPC, 1860, the complaint must, prima facie, reﬂect a\\ncommon prior concert or planning amongst all the accused.238.'), ('34.12', 'Effect of no charge under section 34.—\\nEven if section 34 has not been included in a charge framed for the offence under\\nsection 302 IPC, 1860 against the accused, a conviction for the offence under section\\n302 with the aid of section 34 is not bad as no prejudice would be caused to him.239.\\nWhere the appellants caused injuries not enough to cause the death but the same were\\ncaused by another, in the absence of a charge under section 34, they were found to be\\nguilty under section 326 of IPC, 1860.240.\\nSections 34, 114 and 149 of the IPC, 1860 provide for criminal liability viewed from\\ndifferent angles as regards actual participants, accessories and men actuated by a\\ncommon object or a common intention; and as explained by ﬁve Judge Constitution\\nBench of in Willie Slavey v The State of MP,241. the charge is a rolled-up one involving\\nthe direct liability and the constructive liability without specifying who are directly liable\\nand who are sought to be made constructively liable.242. But before a court can convict\\na person under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, it should\\ncome to a deﬁnite conclusion that the said person had a prior concert with one or more\\nother persons, named or unnamed, for committing the said offence. A few illustrations\\nwill bring out the impact of section 34 on different situations.\\n(1) A, B, C and D are charged under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian\\nPenal Code, for committing the murder of E. The evidence is directed to establish that\\nthe said four persons have taken part in the murder.\\n(2) A, B, C and D and unnamed others are charged under the said sections. But\\nevidence is adduced to prove that the said persons, along with others, named or\\nunnamed, participated jointly in the commission of that offence.\\n(3) A, B, C and D are charged under the said sections. But the evidence is directed to\\nprove that A, B, C and D, along with 3 others, have jointly committed the offence. As\\nregards the third illustration, a Court is certainly entitled to come to the conclusion that\\none of the named accused is guilty of murder under section 302, read with section 34,\\nof the Indian Penal Code, though the other three named accused are acquitted, if it\\naccepts the evidence that the said accused acted in concert along with persons,\\nnamed or unnamed, other than those acquitted, in the commission of the offence. In\\nthe second illustration the Court can come to the same conclusion and convict one of\\nthe named accused if it is satisﬁed that no prejudice has been caused to the accused\\nby the defect in the charge. But in the ﬁrst illustration the Court certainly can convict\\ntwo or more of the named accused if it accepts the evidence that they acted conjointly\\nin committing the offence. But what is the position if the Court acquits 3 of the 4\\naccused either because it rejects the prosecution evidence or because it gives the\\nbeneﬁt of doubt to the said accused? Can it hold, in the absence of a charge as well as\\nevidence, that though the three accused are acquitted, some other unidentiﬁed persons\\nacted conjointly along with one of the named persons? If the Court could do so, it\\nwould be making out a new case for the prosecution: it would be deciding contrary to\\nthe evidence adduced in the case. A Court cannot obviously make out a case for the\\nprosecution which is not disclosed either in the charge or in regard to which there is no\\nbasis in the evidence. There must be some foundation in the evidence that persons\\nother than those named have taken part in the commission of the offence and if there\\nis such a basis the case will be covered by the third illustration.243. Absence of charge\\nunder section 34 is not fatal by itself unless prejudice to the accused is shown.244.'), ('34.13', 'Alternative Charge.—\\nThe trial Court framed charges under sections 302/307 r/w 120B IPC, 1860 and an\\nalternative charge under sections 302/307 r/w section 34 IPC, 1860 without opining on\\nthe alternative charge, convicted the accused under sections 302/307 r/w 120B, The\\ncontention that accused is deemed to be acquitted for charges under sections\\n302/307/34 IPC, 1860 of the charge of common intention of committing murder and\\nthere was no appeal by the State against the deemed acquittal against that charge, it\\nwas not open to the High Court to alter or modify the conviction under sections\\n302/307/34 IPC, 1860, repelled by holding that charges had indeed been framed in the\\nalternative and for cognate offences having similar ingredients as the main allegation\\nof murder.245.'), ('34.14', 'Distinction between sections 34 and 149, IPC, 1860.—\\nThough both these sections relate to the doctrine of vicarious liability and sometimes\\noverlap each other there are substantial points of difference between the two. They are\\nas under:—\\n(i) Section 34 does not by itself create any speciﬁc offence, whereas section 149,\\nIPC, 1860, does so (see discussion under sub-para \"principle\" ante).\\n(ii) Some active participation, especially in a crime involving physical violence is\\nnecessary under section 34 but section 149, IPC, 1860, does not require it and\\nthe liability arises by reason of mere membership of the unlawful assembly with\\na common object and there may be no active participation at all in the\\npreparation and commission of the crime.\\n(iii) Section 34 speaks of common intention but section 149, IPC, 1860,\\ncontemplates common object which is undoubtedly wider in its scope and\\namplitude than intention. If the offence committed by a member of an unlawful\\nassembly is in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or\\nsuch as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in\\nprosecution of the common object, all other members of the unlawful assembly\\nwould be guilty of that offence under section 149, IPC, 1860, although they may\\nnot have intended to do it or participated in the actual commission of that\\noffence.246.\\n(iv) Section 34 does not ﬁx a minimum number of persons who must share the\\ncommon intention, whereas section 149, IPC, 1860, requires that there must be\\nat least ﬁve persons who must have the same common object (see also\\ndiscussion under sub-head \"Sections 34 and 149\" under section 149, IPC, 1860,\\ninfra).247.'), ('34.15', 'Effect of conviction or acquittal of one or more or others.—\\nSeveral persons involved in a criminal adventure may be guilty of different offences\\ndepending upon their respective acts. If the act is done in furtherance of their common\\nintention, all of them become equally liable for the act. Similarly, if they are members of\\nan unlawful assembly, an act done by any one in prosecution of the common object or\\nany act which the members knew could happen in such prosecution, every member\\nwould be liable for the act. If any one of them happens to be wrongly acquitted and no\\nappeal has been ﬁled against it, it would not ipso facto impede the conviction of others.\\nLikewise, the conviction of any one or more them does not automatically result in the\\nconviction of others.248.'), ('34.16', 'Substitution of conviction from section 149 to section 34.—\\nFollowing some earlier rulings,249. the Supreme Court has stated the law in the\\nfollowing terms:250.\\nIt is true that there was no charge under s. 302 read with s. 34... but the facts of the case\\nare such that the accused could have been charged alternatively either under s. 302 read\\nwith s. 149 or under s. 302 read with s. 34 and one of the accused having been acquitted,\\nthe conviction under s. 302/149 can be substituted with one under s. 302/34.

A plain reading of section 397 of the IPC,\\n1860 would make it clear that such guilt can be attributed only to that offender who\\nuses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt to any person during course of the\\ncommission of the robbery. The provision postulates that only the individual act of\\naccused will be relevant to attract section 397 of the IPC, 1860.252.

Though all the accused\\nwould be liable for committing the murder of a person by doing an act or acts in\\nfurtherance of the common intention, they would not be liable for the act or acts if they\\nhad the right of private defence to voluntarily cause death of that person. Common\\nintention, therefore, has relevance only to the offence and not to the right of private\\ndefence. What would be an offence by reason of constructive liability would cease to\\nbe one if the act constituting the offence was done in exercise of the right of private\\ndefence.\\nIf the voluntary causing of death is not permissible under the right of private defence\\nunder section 96, then the common intention in regard thereto will lead to the result\\nthat the accused persons must be held guilty by reason of constructive liability under\\nthe relevant section (in this case section 304 Part I IPC, 1860). If, however, the common\\nintention was only to commit an act which was permissible within the conﬁnes of s. 96\\nread with s. 98, then constructive liability under section 34 cannot be said to have been\\naccrued to the accused.

There is no statutory offence that takes place when adults willingly\\nengage in sexual relations outside the marital setting, with the exception of \\'adultery\\' as\\ndeﬁned under section 497 IPC, 1860.285. In Joseph Shine v UOI286. a ﬁve judge\\nConstitution bench of the Supreme Court struck down section 497 of the Indian Penal\\nCode as manifestly discriminatory and arbitrary. Section 2(n) of Cr PC, 1973 deﬁnes\\noffence as any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force\\nand includes any act in respect of which a complaint may be under section 20 of the\\nCattle Trespass Act 1871 (1 of 1871). Thus, the deﬁnition of \\'offence\\' under section\\n2(n), Cr PC, 1973, is wider enough to enable the police to investigate into offences\\nunder other enactments also, apart from those under the IPC, 1860.287. An offence\\nseldom consists of a single act. It is usually composed of several elements and, as a\\nrule; a whole series of acts must be proved before it can be established.288. There is a\\nbasic difference between the offences under the Penal Code and acts and omissions\\nwhich have been made punishable under different Acts and statutes which are in\\nnature of social welfare legislations. For framing charges in respect of those acts and\\nomissions, in many cases, mens rea is not an essential ingredient; the concerned\\nstatute imposes a duty on those who are in charge of the management, to follow the\\nstatutory provisions and once there is a breach or contravention, such persons become\\nliable to be punished. But for framing a charge for an offence under the Penal Code, the\\ntraditional rule of existence of mens rea is to be followed.289. In the absence of a\\ndeﬁnition in a special act, the term \\'offence\\' should be understood in the context of\\nsection 40 of the Indian Penal Code as an act that is criminally punishable and section\\n3(38) of the General Clauses Act as an act made punishable by any law and the\\nessential ingredient is that it should be a criminal act as understood.290.

This judgement of the\\nDelhi High Court was later overruled by the Supreme Court on 12 December 2013 in\\nSuresh Kumar Koushal case.293. Finally in Navtej Singh Johar v UOI,294. a ﬁve-judge\\nbench of the Supreme Court declared section 377 of the Indian Penal Code\\nunconstitutional, insofar as it criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults of same\\nsex in private.

There is no statutory offence that takes place when adults willingly\\nengage in sexual relations outside the marital setting, with the exception of \\'adultery\\' as\\ndeﬁned under section 497 IPC, 1860.285. In Joseph Shine v UOI286. a ﬁve judge\\nConstitution bench of the Supreme Court struck down section 497 of the Indian Penal\\nCode as manifestly discriminatory and arbitrary. Section 2(n) of Cr PC, 1973 deﬁnes\\noffence as any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force\\nand includes any act in respect of which a complaint may be under section 20 of the\\nCattle Trespass Act 1871 (1 of 1871). Thus, the deﬁnition of \\'offence\\' under section\\n2(n), Cr PC, 1973, is wider enough to enable the police to investigate into offences\\nunder other enactments also, apart from those under the IPC, 1860.287. An offence\\nseldom consists of a single act. It is usually composed of several elements and, as a\\nrule; a whole series of acts must be proved before it can be established.288. There is a\\nbasic difference between the offences under the Penal Code and acts and omissions\\nwhich have been made punishable under different Acts and statutes which are in\\nnature of social welfare legislations. For framing charges in respect of those acts and\\nomissions, in many cases, mens rea is not an essential ingredient; the concerned\\nstatute imposes a duty on those who are in charge of the management, to follow the\\nstatutory provisions and once there is a breach or contravention, such persons become\\nliable to be punished. But for framing a charge for an offence under the Penal Code, the\\ntraditional rule of existence of mens rea is to be followed.289. In the absence of a\\ndeﬁnition in a special act, the term \\'offence\\' should be understood in the context of\\nsection 40 of the Indian Penal Code as an act that is criminally punishable and section\\n3(38) of the General Clauses Act as an act made punishable by any law and the\\nessential ingredient is that it should be a criminal act as understood.290. In Naz\\nFoundation v NCT Delhi.291. section 377 of IPC, 1860 in so far it criminalised\\nconsensual sexual acts of adults in private, was held violative of Article 21, Article 14\\nand Article 15 of the Constitution by the Delhi High Court.292. This judgement of the\\nDelhi High Court was later overruled by the Supreme Court on 12 December 2013 in\\nSuresh Kumar Koushal case.293. Finally in Navtej Singh Johar v UOI,294. a ﬁve-judge\\nbench of the Supreme Court declared section 377 of the Indian Penal Code\\nunconstitutional, insofar as it criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults of same\\nsex in private.

      "[('52', '\"Good faith.\".\\nNothing is said to be done or believed in \"good faith\" which is done or believed without\\ndue care and attention.\\nCOMMENT—\\nThe expression \"good faith\" in criminal jurisprudence has a deﬁnite connotation. Its\\nimport is totally different from saying that the person concerned has honestly believed\\nthe truth of what is said. See the language of the law in this regard. It starts in the\\nnegative tone excluding all except what is allowed to be within its amplitude. Insistence\\nsought to be achieved through the commencing words of the deﬁnition \"nothing is said\\nto be done or believed in good faith\" is that the solitary item included within the purview\\nof the expression \"good faith\" is what is done with \"due care and attention\". Due care\\ndenotes the degree of reasonableness in the care sought to be exercised. In Black\\'s\\nLaw Dictionary, \"reasonable care\" is explained as \"such a degree of care, precaution, or\\ndiligence as may fairly and properly be expected or required, having regard to the\\nnature of the action, or of the subject matter and the circumstances surrounding the\\ntransaction. It is such care as an ordinary prudent person would exercise under the\\nconditions existing at the time he is called upon to act\".331. The element of honesty\\nwhich is introduced by the deﬁnition prescribed by the General Clauses Act is not\\nintroduced by the deﬁnition of the Penal Code; and we are governed by the deﬁnition\\nprescribed by section 52 of that Code.332. Nothing is an offence which is done by any\\nperson who is justiﬁed by law, or who by reason of mistake of fact and not by reason of\\nmistake of law, in good faith, believes himself to be justiﬁed by law, in doing it.333.\\nSome parents made poisonous propaganda against an educational institution.

Some\\nattempts have been made to modernise our penal system through piecemeal\\nlegislation at best for the ﬁrst offenders, the children and the juvenile delinquents\\nexample the Probation of Offenders Act 1958, the Juvenile Justice (Care and\\nProtection of Children) Act 2000, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act,\\n2015 etc. In the Indian Penal Code, there is no scope for individualising the punishment;\\nrather these ﬁve forms of punishment have to be doled out to the offenders irrespective\\nof their psycho-social problems and needs of individual offenders. Commenting on this\\nunhappy aspect of our penal system Krishna iyer, J, observed in Shivaji\\'s case\\'.3.\\nTwo men in their twenties thus stand convicted of murder and have to suffer imprisonment\\nfor life because the punitive strategy of our Penal Code does not suﬃciently reﬂect the\\nmodern trends in correctional treatment and personalised sentencing. When accused\\npersons are of tender age then even in a murder case it is not desirable to send them\\nbeyond the high prison walls and forget all about their correction and eventual reformation.\\nIn Inder Singh\\'s case4. the Supreme Court issued directions to the State Government to\\nsee that the young accused of the case are not given any degrading work and they are\\ngiven the beneﬁt of liberal parole every year if their behaviour shows responsibility and\\ntrustworthiness. Moreover, the Sessions Judge was directed to make jail visits to\\nensure compliance with these directions.'), ('53.1', 'Object of Punishment.—\\nOne of the prime objectives of criminal law is imposition of appropriate, adequate, just\\nand proportionate sentence commensurate with the nature and gravity of crime and\\nthe manner in which the crime is done.5. Undue sympathy by means of imposing\\ninadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system and undermine the\\npublic conﬁdence in the eﬃcacy of law.6. The object should be to protect the society\\nand to deter the criminal in achieving the avowed object to law by imposing appropriate\\nsentence. It is expected that the Courts would operate the sentencing system so as to\\nimpose such sentence which reﬂects the conscience of the society and the sentencing\\nprocess has to be stern where it should be.7. The main purpose of the sentence broadly\\nstated is that the accused must realise that he has committed an act which is not only\\nharmful to the society of which he forms an integral part but is also harmful to his own\\nfuture, both as an individual and as a member of the society. Punishment is designed\\nto protect society by deterring potential offenders as also by preventing the guilty party\\nfrom repeating the offence; it is also designed to reform the offender and re-claim him\\nas a law-abiding citizen for the good of the society as a whole. Reformatory, deterrent\\nand punitive aspects of punishment thus play their due part in judicial thinking while\\ndetermining this question. In modern civilized societies, however, reformatory aspect is\\nbeing given somewhat greater importance. Too lenient as well as too harsh sentences\\nboth lose their eﬃcaciousness. One does not deter and the other may frustrate thereby\\nmaking the offender a hardened criminal.8.'), ('53.2', \"Different Approaches.—\\nPunishment in criminal cases is both punitive and reformative. The purpose is that the\\nperson found guilty of committing the offence is made to realise his fault and is\\ndeterred from repeating such acts in future. On the commission of crime, three types of\\nreactions may generate; the traditional reaction of universal nature which is termed as\\npunitive approach. It regards the criminal as a notoriously dangerous person who must\\nbe inﬂicted severe punishment to protect the society from his criminal assaults. The\\nother approach is the therapeutic approach. It regards the criminal as a sick person\\nrequiring treatment, while the third is the preventive approach, which seeks to eliminate\\nthose conditions from the society, which were responsible for crime causation. Under\\nthe punitive approach, the rationalisation of punishment is based on retributive and\\nutilitarian theories. Deterrent theory, which is also part of the punitive approach,\\nproceeds on the basis that the punishment should act as a deterrent not only to the\\noffender, but also to others in the community. The therapeutic approach aims at curing\\nthe criminal tendencies, which were the product of a diseased psychology. Therapeutic\\napproach has since been treated as an effective method of punishment, which not only\\nsatisﬁes the requirements of law that a criminal should be punished and the\\npunishment prescribed must be meted out to him, but also reforms the criminal\\nthrough various processes, the most fundamental of which is that in spite of having\\ncommitted a crime, may be a heinous crime, he should be treated as a human being\\nentitled to all the basic human rights, human dignity and human sympathy. It was under\\nthis theory that this Court in a stream of decisions, projected the need for prison\\nreforms, the need to acknowledge the vital fact that the prisoner, after being lodged in\\njail, does not lose his fundamental rights or basic human rights and that he must be\\ntreated with compassion and sympathy.9. Imposing a hard punishment on the accused\\nserves a limited purpose, but at the same time, it is to be kept in mind that relevance of\\ndeterrent punishment in matters of serious crimes affecting society should not be\\nundermined. Within the parameters of the law an attempt has to be made to afford an\\nopportunity to the individual to reform himself and lead life of a normal, useful member\\nof society and make his contribution in that regard.10. In Dhannajoy Chatterjee v State of\\nWB,11. the Supreme Court has observed that shockingly large number of criminals go\\nunpunished, thereby increasingly encouraging the criminals and ultimately making\\njustice suffer by weakening the system's credibility. Realising that it is not the brutality\\nof punishment but its surety that serves as a greater deterrent, our Supreme Court held\\nthat a barbaric crime does not have to be visited with a barbaric penalty such as public\\nhanging which will be clearly violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.12. With regards\\nthe question of punishment, it should be noted that punishment in one matter cannot\\nbe the guiding factor for punishment in another. Punishment has a co-relation with\\nfacts and in each case where punishment is imposed, the same must be the resultant\\neffect of the acts complained of. More serious the violation, more severe is the\\npunishment and that has been the accepted norm, in matters though, however, within\\nthe prescribed limits.13.\"), ('53.3', 'Reformation Theory.—\\nThe reformative aspect is meant to enable the person concerned to relent and repent\\nfor his action and make himself acceptable to the society as a useful social being.14.\\nTheory of reformation through punishment is grounded on the sublime philosophy that\\nevery man is born good but circumstances transform him into a criminal. The aphorism\\nthat \"if every saint has a past every sinner has a future\" is a tested philosophy\\nconcerning human life. VR Krishna Iyer, J, has taken pains to ornately fresco the\\nreformative proﬁle of the principles of sentencing in Mohammad Giasuddin v State of\\nAP.15. Reformation should hence be the dominant objective of a punishment and\\nduring incarceration, every effort should be made to recreate the good man out of\\nconvicted prisoner. An assurance to him that his hard labour would eventually snowball\\ninto a handsome saving for his own rehabilitation would help him to get stripped of the\\nmoroseness and desperation in his mind while toiling with the rigours of hard labour\\nduring the period of his jail life. Thus, reformation and rehabilitation of a prisoner are of\\ngreat public policy. Hence, they serve a public purpose.16. Punishment is also to reform\\nsuch wrongdoers not to commit such offence in future.17.'), ('53.4', 'Deterrence.—\\nDeterrence is one of the vital considerations of punishment. Law demands that the\\noffender should be adequately punished for the crime, so that it can deter the offender\\nand other persons from committing similar offences. Nature and circumstances of the\\noffence; the need for the sentence imposed to reﬂect the seriousness of the offence; to\\nafford adequate deterrence to the conduct and to protect the public from such crimes\\nare certain factors to be considered while imposing the sentence.18. Any liberal attitude\\nby imposing meagre sentences or taking too sympathetic view merely on account of\\nlapse of time or personal inconveniences in respect of such offences will be result-wise\\ncounterproductive in the long run and against societal interest which needs to be cared\\nfor and strengthened by string of deterrence built in the sentencing system.19. For\\ninstance, a murder committed due to deep-seated mutual and personal rivalry may not\\ncall for penalty of death. However, an organised crime or mass murders of innocent\\npeople would call for imposition of death sentence as deterrence.20. Protection of\\nsociety and deterring the criminal is the avowed object of law and is required to be\\nachieved by imposing an appropriate sentence. The sentencing Courts are expected to\\nconsider all relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question of sentence and\\nproceed to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offence. Courts\\nmust hear the loud cry for justice by the society in cases of heinous crimes like rape on\\ninnocent helpless girls of tender years, as in this case, and respond by imposition of\\nproper sentence. Public abhorrence of the crime needs reﬂection through imposition of\\nappropriate sentence by the Court. To show mercy in the case of such a heinous crime\\nwould be a travesty of justice.21. To give a lesser punishment to the appellants would\\nbe to render the justice system of this country suspect. The common man will lose\\nfaith in the Courts. In such cases, he understands and appreciates the language of\\ndeterrence more than the reformative jargon.22. Punishment to an accused in criminal\\njurisprudence is not merely to punish the wrongdoer but also to strike warning to those\\nwho are in the same sphere of crime or to those intending to join in such crime.23.'), ('53.5', \"Principles of sentencing.—\\nSentencing is an important task in the matters of crime. There is no straitjacket\\nformula for sentencing an accused on proof of crime. In practice, there is much\\nvariance in the matter of sentencing. In many countries, there are laws prescribing\\nsentencing guidelines, but there is no statutory sentencing policy in India.24. The Indian\\nPenal Code provides discretion to Indian Judges while awarding the sentence.25.\\nCourts have wide discretion in awarding sentence within the statutory limits.26. The\\nCourts have evolved certain principles: twin objective of the sentencing policy is\\ndeterrence and correction.27. There are many philosophies behind sentencing justifying\\npenal consequences. The philosophical/jurisprudential justiﬁcation can be retribution,\\nincapacitation, speciﬁc deterrence, general deterrence, rehabilitation, or restoration.\\nAnyone or a combination thereof can be the goal of sentencing. However, when it\\ncomes to sentencing a person for committing a heinous crime, the deterrence theory\\nas a rationale for punishing the offender becomes more relevant. In such cases, the\\nrole of mercy, forgiveness and compassion becomes secondary and while determining\\nthe quantum of sentence, discretion lies with the Court. While exercising such a\\ndiscretion, the Court has to govern itself by reason and fair play, and discretion is not to\\nbe exercised according to whim and caprice. It is the duty of the Court to impose\\nadequate sentence, for one of the purposes of imposition of requisite sentence is\\nprotection of the society and a legitimate response to the collective conscience. While\\nconsidering as to what would be the appropriate quantum of imprisonment, the Court\\nis empowered to take into consideration mitigating circumstances, as well as\\naggravating circumstances.28. What sentence would meet the ends of justice depends\\non the facts and circumstances of each case and the Court must keep in mind the\\ngravity of the crime, motive for the crime, nature of the offence and all other attendant\\ncircumstances.29. The criminal law adheres in general to the principle of proportionality\\nin prescribing liability according to the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct. It\\nordinarily allows some signiﬁcant discretion to the Judge in arriving at a sentence in\\neach case, presumably to permit sentences that reﬂect more subtle considerations of\\nculpability that are raised by the special facts of each case. Judges in essence aﬃrm\\nthat punishment ought always to ﬁt the crime; yet in practice, sentences are\\ndetermined largely by other considerations. Sometimes it is the correctional needs of\\nthe perpetrator that are offered to justify a sentence, sometimes the desirability of\\nkeeping him out of circulation, and sometimes even the tragic results of his crime.\\nInevitably, these considerations cause a departure from just desert as the basis of\\npunishment and create cases of apparent injustice that are serious and widespread.30.\\nProportion between crime and punishment is a goal respected in principle, and in spite\\nof errant notions, it remains a strong inﬂuence in the determination of sentences. The\\npractice of punishing all serious crimes with equal severity is now unknown in civilized\\nsocieties, but such a radical departure from the principle of proportionality has\\ndisappeared from the law only in recent times. Even now for a single grave infraction,\\ndrastic sentences are imposed. Anything less than a penalty of greatest severity for\\nany serious crime is thought then to be a measure of toleration that is unwarranted and\\nunwise. But in fact, quite apart from those considerations that make punishment\\nunjustiﬁable when it is out of proportion to the crime, uniformly disproportionate\\npunishment has some very undesirable practical consequences.31. The principle of\\nproportionality in sentencing a crime doer is well entrenched in criminal jurisprudence.\\nAs a matter of law, proportion between crime and punishment bears most relevant\\ninﬂuence in determination of sentencing the crime doer. The Court has to take into\\nconsideration all aspects including social interest and consciousness of the society for\\naward of appropriate sentence.32. Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence\\nwould do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public conﬁdence in the\\neﬃcacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats.\\nImposition of sentence without considering its effect on the social order in many cases\\nmay be in reality a futile exercise. The social impact of the crime e.g. where it relates to\\noffences against women, dacoity, kidnapping, misappropriation of public money,\\ntreason and other offences involving moral turpitude or moral delinquency which have\\ngreat impact on social order and public interest, cannot be lost sight of and per se\\nrequire exemplary treatment. Any liberal attitude by imposing meagre sentences or\\ntaking too sympathetic view merely on account of lapse of time in respect of such\\noffences will be result wise counterproductive in the long run and against societal\\ninterest which needs to be cared for and strengthened by a string of deterrence inbuilt\\nin the sentencing system.33. Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do\\nmore harm to the justice system to undermine the public conﬁdence in the eﬃcacy of\\nlaw and society could not long endure under such serious threats. It is, therefore, the\\nduty of every Court to award proper sentence keeping in mind the nature of the offence\\nand the manner in which it was executed or committed etc. Thus, it is evident that\\nCriminal Law requires strict adherence to the rule of proportionality in providing\\npunishment according to the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct keeping in\\nmind the effect of not awarding just punishment on the society.34. An undeserved\\nindulgence or liberal attitude in not awarding adequate sentence in such cases would\\namount to allowing or even to encouraging 'potential criminals'. The society can no\\nlonger endure under such serious threats. Courts must hear the loud cry for justice by\\nsociety in cases of heinous crime of rape and impose adequate sentence. Public\\nabhorrence of the crime needs reﬂection through imposition of appropriate sentence\\nby the Court.35.\"), ('53.6', 'Factors to be considered.—\\nThese are some factors which are required to be taken into consideration before\\nawarding appropriate sentence to the accused. These factors are only illustrative in\\ncharacter and not exhaustive. Each case has to be seen from its special perspective.\\nThe relevant factors are as under:\\n(a) Motive or previous enmity;\\n(b) Whether the incident had taken place on the spur of the moment;\\n(c) The intention/knowledge of the accused while inﬂicting the blow or injury;\\n(d) Whether the death ensued instantaneously or the victim died after several days;\\n(e) The gravity, dimension and nature of injury;\\n(f) The age and general health condition of the accused;\\n(g) Whether the injury was caused without pre-meditation in a sudden ﬁght;\\n(h) The nature and size of weapon used for inﬂicting the injury and the force with which\\nthe blow was inﬂicted;\\n(i) The criminal background and adverse history of the accused;\\n(j) Whether the injury inﬂicted was not suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to\\ncause death but the death was because of shock;\\n(k) Number of other criminal cases pending against the accused;\\n(l) Incident occurred within the family members or close relations;\\n(m) The conduct and behaviour of the accused after the incident. Whether the accused\\nhad taken the injured/the deceased to the hospital immediately to ensure that he/she\\ngets proper medical treatment?\\nThese are some of the factors which can be taken into consideration while granting an\\nappropriate sentence to the accused.\\nThe list of circumstances enumerated above is only illustrative and not exhaustive. In\\nour considered view, proper and appropriate sentence to the accused is the bounded\\nobligation and duty of the Court. The endeavour of the Court must be to ensure that the\\naccused receives appropriate sentence, in other words, sentence should be according\\nto the gravity of the offence. These are some of the relevant factors which are required\\nto be kept in view while convicting and sentencing the accused.36. The facts and given\\ncircumstances in each case, the nature of the crime, the manner in which it was\\nplanned and committed, the motive for commission of the crime, the conduct of the\\naccused, the nature of weapons used and all other attending circumstances are\\nrelevant facts which would enter into the area of consideration.37.'), ('53.7', \"Judicial Discretion:38. Cases.—\\nA Judge has wide discretion in awarding the sentence within the statutory limits. Since\\nin many offences, only the maximum punishment is prescribed and for some offences\\nthe minimum punishment is prescribed, each Judge exercises his discretion\\naccordingly.39. In case where for an offence, maximum imprisonment is prescribed and\\nthere is no provision for minimum imprisonment, the Court can exercise wide\\ndiscretion imposing any imprisonment which may be from one day (or even till the\\nrising of the court) to ten years/life.40. However, the Courts will have to take into\\naccount certain principles while exercising their discretion in sentencing, such as\\nproportionality, deterrence and rehabilitation. In a proportionality analysis, it is\\nnecessary to assess the seriousness of an offence in order to determine the\\ncommensurate punishment for the offender.41. Though punishment is the discretion of\\nthe Court, yet it must be exercised judicially and where circumstances call for a\\ndeterrent punishment, it ought to be awarded in an appropriate case.42. Thus where the\\naccused, a young man of 22 committed multiple murders for sheer gain in a most\\ncruel, callous and ﬁendish fashion, there was no way to show him any mercy as it was\\nrarest of the rare cases where a sentence of death was fully justiﬁed.43. In exercising\\nthis discretion, the Court must consider the gravity of the offence, the mitigating or the\\nextenuating circumstances of the case which may justify the award of the lesser or\\nmaximum sentence.44. Where the accused was a youth of 19, the Supreme Court while\\nupholding conviction under section 304-Part I, Indian Penal Code, 1860, (IPC, 1860)\\nreduced his sentence to the period already undergone which was 18 and a half months\\nin the instant case. The accused, a Government servant, who will lose pensionary\\nbeneﬁts due to conviction, deserves to be treated leniently.\\nThe Supreme Court has laid down that in cases of death in custody on account of third\\ndegree methods, deterrent punishment should be awarded.45. Where certain police\\noﬃcials, who took a man illegally in their custody and gave him beating due to which he\\ndied, were convicted under section 342, it was held that the facts that one of the\\naccused was recipient of a medal from the President for saving a life, was awarded Rs.\\n5,000 by the State Government also and was suffering from T.B. and the other accused\\nhad acted on the direction of his superior, were not mitigating circumstances and the\\naccused were liable to be punished with the maximum sentence.46.\\nWhere due to dire poverty the accused killed his ailing wife, as he could not provide\\nmoney for her operation and thereafter killed his two children, as they would be\\nneglected after their mother's death, it was held the accused deserved to be awarded\\nlife imprisonment and not capital punishment.47. Where the murder in question showed\\nsigns of ruthless, unrelenting and determined vindictiveness and though the accused\\nwas 55 at the time of occurrence and 70 at the time of this appeal, the Supreme Court\\ndid not think it necessary to modify his sentence of life imprisonment.48. Similarly,\\nwhere murders were committed for gain, the Supreme Court refused to interfere with\\ndeath sentence only because the condemned prisoners were very young and their\\nwives and children and aged parents were dependent on them. Such considerations,\\nthe Court said, are present in most cases.49. Where, for the offence of dacoity under\\nsection 395, the trial Court awarded three years' R.I., the High Court acquitted the\\noffenders, but the Supreme Court restored the conviction after a long gap during which\\nthey got married and had resumed normal life, the period already undergone was\\nconsidered to be suﬃcient, but a ﬁne of Rs. 3,000 was imposed on each of them.50.\\nWhere a conviction under section 16I, IPC, 1860 read with section 5(2) of the\\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988 was conﬁrmed, the Gujarat High Court modiﬁed the\\nsentence of R.I. for one year and ordered that the appellant shall undergo sentence of\\nR.I. for six months only. This was done in view of his age of 60 years and a number of\\nillnesses he was suffering from.51. The accused had been out of job for nearly 16 years\\nand had undergone the trial for a number of years. He was 65 years old but had\\nreceived no pension and had a large family to maintain. Hence, the Supreme Court\\nwhile conﬁrming the conviction, reduced the sentence of one year R.I. each under\\nsection 161 and the Prevention of Corruption Act to 15 days R.I. on each count. The\\nsentence of ﬁne was however conﬁrmed.52. Where the accused had accepted a very\\nsmall amount of Rs. 30 as bribe about 16 years back and underwent the agony of trial\\nfor a long time and had to support his family, he had been in jail for some time during\\ntrial, considering these facts his sentence of imprisonment was reduced from three\\nmonths R.I. to the period already undergone.53.\\nImposition of proper and appropriate sentence is bounded obligation and duty of the\\nCourt. The endeavour of the Court must be to ensure that the accused received\\nappropriate sentence. The sentence must be accorded to the gravity of the offence.54.\"), ('53.8', 'Minimum Sentence.—\\nIn order to exercise the discretion of reducing the sentence the statutory requirement is\\nthat the Court has to record \"adequate and special reasons\" in the judgment and not\\nfanciful reasons, which would permit the Court to impose a sentence less than the\\nprescribed minimum. The reason has not only to be adequate but also special. What is\\nadequate and special would depend upon several factors and no straitjacket formula\\ncan be indicated.55.

Thus, while a person sentenced to simple\\nimprisonment has the option of choosing to work, a person sentenced to rigorous\\nimprisonment is required by law to undergo hard labour. The under trials are not\\nrequired to work in Jail.69.

Broadly stated that the PO Act distinguishes offenders\\nbelow 21 years of age and those above that age, and offenders who are not guilty of\\nhaving committed an offence punishable with death or that imprisonment for life and\\nthose who are guilty of a lesser offence. While in the case of offenders who are above\\nthe age of 21 years absolute discretion is given to the Court to release them after\\nadmonition or on probation of good conduct, subject to the conditions laid down in the\\nappropriate provisions of the PO Act.

The stage for the exercise of this power generally\\nspeaking is post-judicial, i.e., after the judicial process has come to an end. After the\\njudicial function ends, the executive function of giving effect to the judicial verdict\\ncommences. Constitutional power under Article 72/161 would override the statutory\\npower contained in sections 432 and 433 and the limitation of section 433A of the\\nCode as well as the power conferred by sections 54 and 55, IPC, 1860.129. No convict\\nhas a fundamental right of remission or shortening of sentence. The State in exercise\\nof its executive power of remission must consider each individual case keeping in view\\nthe relevant factors. The power of the State to issue general instructions, so that no\\ndiscrimination is made, is also permissible in law.130. Exercise of executive clemency is\\na matter of discretion and yet subject to certain standards. It is not a matter of\\nprivilege.131. A right to be considered for remission, keeping in view the constitutional\\nsafeguards of a convict under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India, must be\\nheld to be a legal one. Such a legal right emanates from not only the Prisons Act but\\nalso from the Rules framed thereunder.132. The power of remission vested in the\\nGovernment under section 433A Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973) is not\\nin conﬂict with Articles 72 and 162 of the Constitution.133. Granting of pardon is in no\\nsense an overturning of a judgment of conviction, but rather it is an executive action\\nthat mitigates or sets aside the punishment for a crime. It eliminates the effect of\\nconviction without addressing the defendant's guilt or innocence.134. It is open to the\\nPresident in the exercise of the power vested in him by Article 72 of the Constitution to\\nscrutinize the evidence on the record of the criminal case and come to a different\\nconclusion from that recorded by the Court in regard to the guilt of, and sentence\\nimposed on, the accused.135.\"), ('54.1', 'Delay in Execution whether entitle commutation of Death sentence to\\nLife Imprisonment.—\\nIn TV Vatheeswaran\\'s case, AIR 1983 SC 361 [LNIND 1983 SC 43] : 1983 SCR (2) 348136.\\na two-Judge Bench of SC considered whether the accused, who was convicted for an\\noffence of murder and sentenced to death, kept in solitary conﬁnement for about eight\\nyears was entitled to commutation of death sentence.

But a three-Judge in Sher Singh v State of\\nPunjab,138. held that though prolonged delay in the execution of a death sentence is\\nunquestionably an important consideration for determining whether the sentence\\nshould be allowed to be commuted, no hard and fast rule that \"delay exceeding two\\nyears in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered suﬃcient to entitle\\nthe person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of\\nthe sentence of death\" can be laid down as has been done in Vatheeswaran Javed\\nAhmed v State of Maharashtra,139. re-iterated the proposition laid down in Vatheeswaran\\n(supra) case and doubted the competence of the three-Judge Bench to overrule the\\nVatheeswaran Case.

No ﬁxed period of delay\\ncould be held to make the sentence of death inexecutable and to this extent the\\ndecision in Vatheeswaran case cannot be said to lay down the correct law.

It is now\\nconclusively settled by a catena of decisions that the punishment of imprisonment for\\nlife handed down by the Court means a sentence of imprisonment for the convict for\\nthe rest of his life.167. However, Supreme Court has been, for quite some time,\\nconscious of the liberal approach and sometimes discriminatory too, taken by the\\nStates in exercise of their power under sections 432 and 433 of Cr PC, 1973 in\\nremitting or commuting sentences. In Jagmohan Singh v State of UP,168.

Taking judicial notice of such a trend, the\\nSupreme Court has, in cases where imposition of death sentence would be too harsh\\nand imprisonment for life (the way it is understood as above) too inadequate, in several\\ncases, has adopted different methods to ensure that the minimum term of life\\nimprisonment ranges from at least 20 years to the end of natural life. However, in some\\ncases, the Court had also been voicing concern about the statutory basis of such\\norders.169.

The jurisdiction to impose a\\ndefault sentence is only incidental to the power to impose a ﬁne and the duty of the\\nCourt to recover the same.194.

The\\nlimitation starts from the date of passing of the sentence of conviction by the trial\\nCourt and not the date of dismissal of the appeal or revision preferred by the\\naccused.220.

But he is liable only to\\none punishment for the whole beating.\\n(b) But if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the\\nblow given to Y is no part of the act whereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is\\nliable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the\\nblow given to Y.\\nCOMMENT—\\nThe section says that where an offence is made up of parts, each of which constitutes\\nan offence, the offender should not be punished for more than one offence unless\\nexpressly provided. Where an offence falls within two or more separate deﬁnitions of\\noffences; or where several acts of which one or more than one would, by itself or\\nthemselves, constitute an offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence, the\\noffender should not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which\\ntries him could award for any one of such offences. The section governs the whole\\nCode and regulates the limit of punishment in cases in which the greater offence is\\nmade up of two or more minor offences. It is not a rule of adjective law or procedure,\\nbut a rule of substantive law regulating the measure of punishment, and it does not,\\ntherefore, affect the question of conviction, which relates to the province of procedure.\\nSection 71 IPC, 1860 as well as section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 talk only of\\npunishment and not of conviction. Thus, conviction of the accused in respect of the\\nsame act for two different offences is quite legal.226. The section contemplates\\nseparate punishments for an offence against the same law and not under different\\nlaws. Where offences are committed under two separate enactments, section 71 IPC,\\n1860 is not helpful to the accused and as such, two separate sentences cannot be\\nquestioned by pressing section 71 into service.227. In order to attract provisions of\\nArticle 20(2) of the Constitution, i.e., doctrine of autrefois acquit or section 300 Cr PC,\\n1973 or section 71 IPC, 1860 or section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897\\ningredients of the offences in the earlier case as well as in the latter case must be the\\nsame and not different. The test to ascertain whether the two offences are the same is\\nnot identity of the allegations but the identity of the ingredients of the offence.228.\\nThe rules for assessment of punishment are laid down in sections 71 and 72 of the\\nIPC, 1860 and section 31 of the Cr PC, 1973. Section 31 of the Code of Criminal\\nProcedure provides that when a person is convicted at one trial of two or more\\noffences, the Court may, subject to the provisions of section 71 of the IPC, 1860,\\nsentence him, for such offences, to the several punishments prescribed therefor which\\nsuch Court is competent to inﬂict; and in the case of consecutive sentences, it shall not\\nbe necessary for the Court, by reason only of the aggregate punishment for the several\\noffence being in excess of the punishment which it is competent to inﬂict on conviction\\nof a single offences, to send the offender for trial before a higher Court. It, therefore,\\nenhances the ordinary powers of sentences given to Magistrates by section 29, Cr PC,\\n1973; but in order to bring a case within the purview of this section, the accused must\\nhave been convicted of two or more offences in the same trial, and the sentence for\\nany one of these offences should not exceed the limits of their ordinary powers. The\\nlimits ﬁxed by this section refer to sentences passed simultaneously, or upon charges\\nwhich are tried simultaneously. Sentences of imprisonment passed under it may run\\nconcurrently. When an accused is convicted at one trial of two or more offences,\\nsection 31(1) of Cr PC, 1973 vests discretion in Court to direct that punishment shall\\nrun concurrently. Court may sentence the accused for such offences to several\\npunishments prescribed therefor, and such punishment would consist of imprisonment\\nto commence, one after expiration of other in such order as the Court may direct,\\nsubject to limitation contained in section 71 of IPC, 1860.229.'), ('71.1', 'Illustration (a).—\\n\"A gives Z ﬁfty strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence of\\nvoluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which\\nmake up whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be\\nimprisoned for 50years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for\\nthe whole beating.\" It is to be noted that the whole beating is considered to constitute\\none offence while each of the blows also amounted to the offence of voluntarily\\ncausing hurt. It can be said, therefore, that while the obtaining of money by cheating on\\nthe presentation of an individual bill did constitute the offence of cheating the\\nobtaining of the entire money in pursuance of the terms of the single contract and the\\nsingle conspiracy entered into also constituted the offence of cheating. When the\\naccused could not be punished with the punishment for more than one such offence it\\ncannot be the intention of law that the accused be charged with each of the offences,\\nwhich were in a way included in the complete offence made up by the entire course of\\nconduct of the accused in pursuance of the conspiracy.230.'), ('71.2', 'Section 71 IPC and section 220 Cr PC.—\\nSection 71 of the IPC, 1860 has to be read in conjunction with section 220 of the Cr PC,\\nrules of criminal pleading in regard to joinder of charges and does not deal with the\\nsentence to be passed on the charges of the offences mentioned in the several\\nillustrations thereunder. Sub-section (5) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973 makes this position\\nabundantly clear. A joint reading of section 71 IPC, 1860 and section 220 Cr PC, 1973\\nclearly shows that clause (2) of section 71 IPC, 1860 approximates sub-section (3) of\\nsection 220 Cr PC, 1973 and clause (3) of section 71 IPC, 1860 corresponds to sub-\\nsection (4) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973. It, therefore, follows that the embargo on\\nseparate sentence under section 71 IPC, 1860 applies only to cases falling within sub-\\nsections (3) and (4) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973 and not under, for example, sub-section\\n(1) of that section.231. Thus in cases covered by illustrations (i), (j) and (k) to sub-\\nsection (3) and illustration (m) to sub-section (4) of section 220 Cr PC, though the\\noffences mentioned therein could be tried together and conviction recorded in regard\\nto each one of them, yet no separate sentences could be passed in view of the\\nembargo contained in section 71 IPC, 1860. Similarly, where the accused was\\nconvicted and sentenced under section 147 IPC, 1860 a separate sentence under\\nsection 143 IPC, 1860 could not be passed.232. In the same way when an accused is\\nconvicted for a more serious offence, e.g., under section 148 IPC, 1860 a separate\\nsentence under section 147 IPC, 1860 is not only uncalled for but illegal.233. It,\\ntherefore, means that cases falling under sub-section (1) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973\\nwhere several distinct offences are committed in course of the same transaction, the\\naccused cannot only be tried and convicted of all of them at one trial but even separate\\nsentences can be passed in regard to each one of them. Thus, where a person\\ncommits lurking house-trespass by night (section 457 IPC, 1860) and also commits\\ntheft (section 380 IPC, 1860) in course of the same transaction, he can be convicted\\nand sentenced separately for both of them.234. Though the offence under section 420,\\nIPC, 1860 and offence under section 138, N.I. Act are very distinct and their ingredients\\nare different, still both the offences were committed during the same transaction;\\naccused could have been charged and tried for both the offences during single trial as\\nper section 220, Cr PC, 1973. However, from the language of section 220, it appears to\\nbe enabling provision whereby two or more different offences may be tried together by\\nthe Court and not mandatory.235.'), ('71.3', 'CASES.—\\nunder sections 330 and 348 to disappear, committed two separate offences under\\nsection 201 and are punishable accordingly.

But, normally, no Court should award two separate punishments for the\\nsame act constituting two offences under section 201. The appropriate sentence under\\nsection 201 for causing the evidence of the offence under section 330 to disappear\\nshould be passed, and no separate sentence need be passed under section 201 for\\ncausing the evidence of the offence under section 348 to disappear.236. Where death\\nwas caused by rash and negligent driving of a truck and the accused could be\\nconvicted under sections 279 and also under sections 304A, it was held that a separate\\nsentence under sections 279 could not be imposed.237.'), ('71.4', 'Rioting and grievous hurt.—\\nThe illustration (a) to section 71 IPC makes it clear that where only an offence is made\\nup of many parts, and then only, the offender shall not be punished for more than one\\nsuch offence.

Section 76 excuses a person who has done what by law is an offence,\\nunder a misconception of facts, leading him to believe in good faith that he was\\ncommanded by law to do it. See Comment on section 79, infra.\\nThis section and sections 77, 78 and 79 deal with acts of a person bound or justiﬁed by\\nlaw. This section as well as sections 78 and 79 deal with acts of a person under a\\nmistake.\\nclaim the beneﬁt of this section it is necessary to show the existence of a state of facts\\nwhich would justify the belief in good faith, interpreting the latter expression with\\nreference to section 52, that the person to whom the order was given was bound by law\\nto obey it. Thus, in the case of a soldier, the Penal Code does not recognize the mere\\nduty of blind obedience to the commands of a superior as suﬃcient to protect him\\nfrom the penal consequences of his act. But in certain circumstances a soldier\\nreceives absolute protection under section 132 of the Cr PC, 1973.\\nFor illegal acts, however, neither the orders of a parent nor a master nor a superior will\\nfurnish any defence. Nothing but fear of instant death is a defence for a policeman who\\ntortures anyone by order of a superior. The maxim respondeat superior has no\\napplication to such a case.6. The net position appears to be that if superior order is in\\nconformity with the law no further question arises and the subordinate oﬃcer is\\nprotected by section 76 IPC, 1860, if he carries out that order. It is only when the order\\nis not in accordance with the law but the subordinate oﬃcer who carries out that order\\nin good faith, on account of a mistake of fact and not on ground of mistake of law,\\nbelieves himself to be bound by law to carry out such an order, that a further question\\narises as to whether the subordinate oﬃcer will not still get protection of section 76\\nIPC, 1860, because of his mistake of fact. Thus, where the order was legal in the\\ncircumstances of the case, e.g., where the police patrol party opened ﬁre under the\\norder of the Deputy Commissioner of Police after it had been attacked on a dark night\\nand an Assistant Commissioner of Police had been injured as a result of such attack,\\nreally no question arose for the application of section 76 IPC, 1860, as the order was\\nboth legal and justiﬁed by the circumstances of the case.7. The Indian law as contained\\nin sections 76 and 79 of the Penal Code appears to be the same as in England. This\\npoint has, however, not been clearly decided in any case including the decision of the\\nSupreme Court in Shew Mangal Singh's case.8.

Under\\nboth (these sections) there must be a bona ﬁde intention to advance the law,\\nmanifested by the circumstances attending the act which is the subject of charge; and\\nthe party accused cannot allege generally that he had a good motive, but must allege\\nspeciﬁcally that he believed in good faith that he was bound by law (section 76) to do\\nas he did, or that being empowered by law (section 79) to act in the matter, he had\\nacted to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith.14.\\noffence, deﬁnitionally speaking but a forbidden act may not spell inevitable guilt if the\\nlaw itself declares that in certain special circumstances it is not to be regarded as an\\noffence. The chapter on General Exceptions operates in this province. Section 79\\nmakes an offence a non-offence. When? Only when the offending act is actually\\njustiﬁed by law or is bona ﬁde believed by mistake of fact to be so justiﬁed.15. It is easy\\nto see that if the act complained of is wholly justiﬁed by law, it would not amount to an\\noffence at all in view of the provisions of section 79 of the IPC, 1860. Many cases may\\nhowever arise wherein acting under the provisions of the Police Act or other law\\nconferring powers on the police, the police oﬃcer or some other person may go beyond\\nwhat is strictly justiﬁed in law. Though section 79 of the IPC, 1860 will have no\\napplication to such cases, section 53 of the Police Act will apply. But section 53 applies\\nto only a limited class of persons. So, it becomes the task of the Court, whenever any\\nquestion whether this section applies or not arises to bestow particular care on its\\ndecision. In doing this it has to ascertain ﬁrst, what act is complained of and then to\\nexamine, if there is any provision of the Police Act or other law conferring powers on\\nthe police, under which it may be said to have been done or intended to be done. The\\nCourt has to remember in this connection that an act is not \"under\" a provision of law\\nmerely because the point of time at which it is done coincides with the point of time\\nwhen some act is done in the exercise of the powers granted by the provision or in\\nperformance of the duty imposed by it. To be able to say that an act is done \"under\" a\\nprovision of law, one must discover the existence of a reasonable relationship between\\nthe provisions and the act. In the absence of such a relation the act cannot be said to\\nbe done \"under\" the particular provision of law.16. But unless there is a reasonable\\nconnection between the act complained of and the powers and duties of the oﬃce, it\\ncannot be said that the act was done by the accused oﬃcer under the colour of his\\noﬃce.17. In Bhanuprasad Hariprasad Dave\\'s case,18. wherein the allegations against the\\npolice oﬃcer was of taking advantage of his position and attempting to coerce a\\nperson to give him a bribe. The plea of colour of duty was negatived by the Supreme\\nCourt. In Prof. Sumer Chand v UOI, 1994 (1) SCC 64 [LNIND 1993 SC 665] Supreme\\nCourt on facts endorsed the opinion of the High Court that the act of the Police Oﬃcer\\ncomplained of fell within the description of `colour of duty\\'. The argument is irresistible\\nthat if the performance of the act which constitutes the offence is justiﬁed by law, i.e.,\\nby some other provision, then section 79 exonerates the doer because the act ceases\\nto be an offence. Likewise, if the act were done by one \\'who by reason of a mistake of\\nfact in good faith believes himself to be justiﬁed by law in doing it\\' then also, the\\nexception operates and the bona ﬁde belief, although mistaken, eliminates the\\nculpability. If the offender can irrefutably establish that he is actually justiﬁed by law in\\ndoing the act or, alternatively, that he entertained a mistake of fact and in good faith\\nbelieved that he was justiﬁed by law in committing the act, then, the weapon of section\\n79 demolishes the prosecution.19.\\nif it is done under a mistake of fact, in the belief in good faith that it is justiﬁed by law it\\nwill not be an offence. Such cases are not uncommon where the Courts in the facts\\nand circumstances of the particular case have exonerated the accused under section\\n79 on the ground of having acted in good faith under the belief, owing to a mistake of\\nfact that he was justiﬁed in doing the act which constituted an offence. As laid down in\\nsection 52 of the IPC, 1860, nothing is said to be done or believed in good faith which is\\ndone or believed without due care and attention. The question of good faith must be\\nconsidered with reference to the position of the accused and the circumstances under\\nwhich he acted. \\'Good faith\\' requires not logical infallibility but due care and attention.\\nThe question of good faith is always a question of fact to be determined in accordance\\nwith the proved facts and circumstances of each case.20.\\n\\'Mistake\\' is not mere forgetfulness.21. It is a slip \"made, not by design, but by\\nmischance.\"22. Under sections 76 and 79 a mistake must be one of fact and not of law.\\nAt common law an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances,\\nwhich, if true, would make the act for which a prisoner is indicted an innocent act has\\nalways been held to be a good defence. Honest and reasonable mistake stands in fact\\non the same footing as absence of the reasoning faculty, as in infancy, or perversion of\\nthat faculty, as in lunacy.23. It may be laid down as a general rule that an alleged\\noffender is deemed to have acted under that state of facts which he in good faith and\\non reasonable grounds believed to exist when he did the act alleged to be an\\noffence.24. Ignorantia facti doth excusat, for such ignorance many times makes the act\\nitself morally involuntary.25. Where a man made a thrust with a sword at a place where,\\nupon reasonable grounds, he supposed a burglar to be, and killed a person who was\\nnot a burglar, it was held that he had committed no offence.26. In other words, he was\\nin the same situation as far as regards the homicide as if he had killed a burglar. The\\naccused while guarding his maize ﬁeld shot an arrow at a moving object in the bona\\nﬁde belief that it was a bear and in the process caused the death of a man who was\\nhiding there. It was held that he could not be held liable for murder as his case was\\nfully covered by section 79 as well as section 80 IPC, 1860.27. Similarly, where the\\naccused while helping the police stopped a cart which they in good faith believed to be\\ncarrying smuggled rice but ultimately their suspicion proved to be incorrect, it was held\\nthat they could not be prosecuted for wrongful restraint under section 341 as their case\\nwas covered by section 79 IPC, 1860.28. Section 79 makes an offence a non-offence.\\nThus, where the Board of Censors, acting within their jurisdiction and on an application\\nmade and pursued in good faith sanctions the public exhibition of a ﬁlm, the producer\\nand the connected agencies do enter the statutory harbour and are protected from\\nprosecution under section 292 IPC, 1860, because section 79 of the Code exonerates\\nthem at least in view of their bona ﬁde belief that the certiﬁcate is justiﬁcatory.29.\\nlaw ordinarily means mistake as to the existence or otherwise of any law on a relevant\\nsubject as well as mistake as to what the law is.30.\\nIgnorance of the municipal law of the Kingdom, or of the penalty thereby inﬂicted upon\\noffenders, doth not excuse any, that is of the age of discretion and compos mentis, from the\\npenalty of the breach of it; because every person of the age of discretion and compos\\nmentis is bound to know the law, and presumed so to do.31.\\nIf any individual should infringe the statute law of the country through ignorance or\\ncarelessness, he must abide by the consequences of his error; it is not competent to\\nhim to aver in a Court of Justice that he was ignorant of the law of the land, and no\\nCourt of Justice is at liberty to receive such a plea.32.\\nThe maxim ignorantia juris non excusat, in its application to criminal offences, admits of\\nno exception, not even in the case of a foreigner who cannot reasonably be supposed\\nin fact to know the law of the land.33. The legal presumption that everyone knows the\\nlaw of the land is often untrue as a matter of fact. But then why such a presumption\\nsubsists? The reason for this seems to be nothing but expediency; otherwise there is\\nno knowing of the extent to which the excuse of ignorance of law might be carried.\\nIndeed, it might be urged almost in every case.34. This rule of expediency has been put\\nto use even in a case where the accused could not have possibly known the law in the\\ncircumstances in which he was placed. Thus, a person who was on the high seas and\\nas such could not have been cognizant of a recently passed law might be convicted for\\ncontravening it.35.\\nWhenever the question of justiﬁcation of an offence either due to mistake of fact or\\nmistake of law arises, the guiding rules are: (1) that when an act is in itself plainly\\ncriminal, and is more severely punishable if certain circumstances co-exist, ignorance\\nof the existence of such circumstances is no answer to a charge for the aggravated\\noffence. (2) That where an act is prima facie innocent and proper, unless certain\\ncircumstances co-exist, then ignorance of such circumstances is an answer to the\\ncharge. (3) That the state of the defendant\\'s mind must amount to absolute ignorance\\nof the existence of the circumstance which alters the character of the act, or to a belief\\nin its non-existence. (4) Where an act which is in itself wrong is, under certain\\ncircumstances, criminal, a person who does the wrong act cannot set up as a defence\\nthat he was ignorant of the facts which turned the wrong into a crime. (5) Where a\\nstatute makes it penal to do an act under certain circumstances, it is a question upon\\nthe wording and object of the particular statute, whether the responsibility of\\nascertaining that the circumstances exist is thrown upon the person who does the act\\nor not. In the former case his knowledge is immaterial.36.'), ('79.1', 'Ignorance of statute newly passed.—\\nAlthough a person commits an act which is made an offence for the ﬁrst time by a\\nstatute so recently passed as to render it impossible that any notice of the passing of\\nthe statute could have reached the place where the offence has been committed, yet\\nhis ignorance of the statute will not save him from punishment.37.

As in self-defence so in\\nthe prevention of harm the accused is faced with two choices both resulting in some\\nharm and of sheer necessity to avoid a greater harm he has to commit an act which\\nwould otherwise be an offence. The test really is like this: there must be a situation in\\nwhich the accused is confronted with a grave danger and he has no choice but to\\ncommit the lesser harm may be even to an innocent person, in order to avoid the\\ngreater harm.

An act is intentional if it exists in idea\\nbefore it exists in fact, the idea realizing itself in the fact because of the desire by which\\nit is accompanied. The motive for an act is not a suﬃcient test to determine its criminal\\ncharacter. By a motive is meant anything that can contribute to give birth to, or even to\\nprevent, any kind of action. Motive may serve as a clue to the intention; but although\\nthe motive is pure, the act done under it may be criminal. Purity of motive will not purge\\nan act of its criminal character.\\nWhere an offence depends upon proof of intention the Court must have proof of facts\\nsuﬃcient to justify in coming to the conclusion that the intention existed.

A statute can exclude that element, but it is a sound rule of\\nconstruction adopted in England and also accepted in India to construe a statutory\\nprovision creating an offence in conformity with the common law rather than against it\\nunless the statute expressly or by necessary implication excludes mens rea. There is a\\npresumption that mens rea is an essential ingredient of a statutory offence; but this\\nmay be rebutted by the express words of a statute creating the offence or by necessary\\nimplication. But the mere fact that the object of a statute is to promote welfare\\nactivities or to eradicate grave social evils is in itself not decisive of the question\\nwhether the element of guilty mind is excluded from the ingredients of the offence. It is\\nalso necessary to enquire whether a statute by putting a person under strict liability\\nhelps him to assist the State in the enforcement of the law; can he do anything to\\npromote the observance of the law? Mens rea by necessary implication can be\\nexcluded from a statute only where it is absolutely clear that the implementation of the\\nobject of a statute would otherwise be defeated and its exclusion enables those put\\nunder strict liability by their act or omission to assist the promotion of the law. The\\nnature of mens rea that will be implied in a statute creating an offence depends upon\\nthe object of the Act and the provisions thereof.70.\\nIt is, however, held that mens rea is an essential ingredient in every offence except in\\nthree cases:\\n(1) cases not criminal in any real sense but which in the public interest are\\nprohibited under a penalty;\\n(2) public nuisance; and\\n(3) cases criminal in form but which are really only a summary mode of enforcing a\\ncivil right.\\nThe maxim actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea has, however, no application in its\\ntechnical sense to the offences under the Penal Code, as the deﬁnitions of various\\noffences contain expressly a proposition as to the state of mind of the accused. In\\nother words, each offence under the Code except offences like waging war (section\\n121), sedition (section 124A), kidnapping and abduction (sections 359, 363) and\\ncounterfeiting coins (section 232) prescribes a mens rea of a speciﬁc kind which is not\\nexactly the same as mens rea in the sense of being a guilty mind under the common\\nlaw. Thus, throughout the web of the IPC, 1860 the doctrine of mens rea runs as a\\nrunning thread in the form of \"intentionally\", \"voluntarily\", \"knowingly\", \"fraudulently\",\\n\"dishonestly\" and the like. It is, therefore, not entirely correct to say that the doctrine of\\nmens rea is inapplicable to the offence under the Penal Code.

The reference came to be made in a\\ncase where Mc Naughten was charged with the murder by shooting of Edward\\nDrummond, who was the Pvt Secretary of the then Prime Minister of England Sir Robert\\nPeel. The accused Mc Naughten produced medical evidence to prove that, he was not,\\nat the time of committing the act, in a sound state of mind. He claimed that he was\\nsuffering from an insane delusion that the Prime Minister was the only reason for all\\nhis problems. He had also claimed that as a result of the insane delusion, he mistook\\nDrummond for the Prime Minister and committed his murder by shooting him. The plea\\nof insanity was accepted and Mc Naughten was found not guilty, on the ground of\\ninsanity. The aforesaid verdict became the subject of debate in the House of Lords.\\nTherefore, it was determined to take the opinion of all the judges on the law governing\\nsuch cases.

But the term\\n\"insanity\" itself has no precise deﬁnition. It is a term used to describe varying degrees\\nof mental disorder. So, every person, who is mentally diseased, is not ipso facto\\nexempted from criminal responsibility. A distinction is to be made between legal\\ninsanity and medical insanity. A Court is concerned with legal insanity, and not with\\nmedical insanity.107. In this case, the accused was under medical treatment prior to the\\noccurrence. Evidence indicating that he remained mentally ﬁt for about four years after\\ntreatment. During the trial also he was sent for treatment and his conduct was normal\\nthereafter. On such facts, it was held, that the accused was not entitled to protection\\nunder section 84. The Court also added that where previous history of insanity of the\\naccused comes to light during investigation, the accused must be medically examined\\nand report placed before the Court. Any lapse in this respect would create inﬁrmity in\\nthe prosecution case and the accused may become entitled to beneﬁt of doubt.\\nof the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from\\ndisease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or, if\\nhe did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.108. If he did know it,\\nhe is responsible.109.\\nIn Sheralli Wali Mohammed v State of Maharashtra,110. it was held that:\\n... it must be proved clearly that, at the time of the commission of the acts, the appellant, by\\nreason of unsoundness of mind, was incapable of either knowing the nature of the act or\\nthat the acts were either morally wrong or contrary to law. The question to be asked is, is\\nthere evidence to show that, at the time of the commission of the offence, he was labouring\\nunder any such incapacity? On this question, the state of his mind before and after the\\ncommission of the offence is relevant.\\nThe crucial point of time for deciding whether the beneﬁt of this section should be\\ngiven or not is the material time when the offence takes place. If at that moment a man\\nis found to be labouring under such a defect of reason as not to know the nature of the\\nact he was doing or that, even if he knew it, he did not know it was either wrong or\\ncontrary to law then this section must be applied. In coming to that conclusion, the\\nrelevant circumstances, like the behaviour of the accused before the commission of\\nthe offence and his behaviour after the commission of the offence, should be taken\\ninto consideration.111. The accused pushed a child of four years into ﬁre resulting in his\\ndeath but there was nothing to show that there was any deliberateness or preparation\\nto commit the crime. His act was accompanied by manifestations of unnatural brutality\\nand was committed openly. He neither concealed nor ran away nor tried to avoid\\ndetection which showed that he was not conscious of his guilt. It was held that the\\naccused was entitled to beneﬁt of section 84 and his conviction under section 302 was\\nset aside.112. The accused, a young boy brought up by his grandfather, went abroad for\\nfurther studies. When his parents visited abroad they did not care to see him. His\\ngrandfather\\'s death was communicated to him much later. On return to India, he\\ncommitted offences of brutal nature at random. During the pendency of the session\\'s\\ncase, he again continued and completed his engineering course and started a printing\\npress and later he managed a garage and allied industries employing nearly 30\\npersons. His behaviour before and after the offences was that of a normal man. It was\\nheld that he was insane at the time of the offence and was given beneﬁt of section\\nschizophrenic and his abnormal behaviour was also apparent from the evidence on the\\nrecord, the Supreme Court held that the acquittal of the accused by the High Court was\\nproper.114.\\nIn other words, to get the beneﬁt of section 84 IPC, 1860, it must be shown that at the\\ntime of the commission of the act the accused by reason of unsoundness of mind was\\nincapable of either knowing the nature of the act or that the act was either morally\\nwrong or contrary to law and for determining this his state of mind before and after the\\ncommission of the offence is most relevant. It would be dangerous to admit the\\ndefence of insanity upon arguments derived merely from the character of the crime.115.\\nThus, the fact that the accused committed the murder over a triﬂing matter and made a\\nclean breast of his crime would not go to show that he was insane.116.'), ('84.4', \"Lucid intervals.—\\nA lucid interval of an insane person is not merely a cessation of the violent symptoms\\nof the disorder, but a restoration of the faculties of the mind suﬃciently to enable the\\nperson soundly to judge the act; but the expression does not necessarily mean\\ncomplete or perfect restoration of the mental faculties to their original condition. So, if\\nthere is such a restoration, the person concerned can do the act with such reason,\\nmemory and judgment as to make it a legal act; merely a cessation of the violent\\nsymptoms of the disorder is not suﬃcient.117.\\nnatural or supervening, whether it arises from disease, or exists from the time of birth,\\nit is included in this expression. It is only 'unsoundness of mind' which naturally impairs\\nthe cognitive faculties of the mind that can form a ground of exemption from criminal\\nresponsibility.118. The nature and extent of the unsoundness of mind required being\\nsuch as would make the offender incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he\\nis doing what is wrong or contrary to law.119. Thus, as Stephen says that if a person\\ncuts off the head of a sleeping man because 'it would be great fun to see him looking\\nfor it when he woke up', it would obviously be a case where the perpetrator of the act\\nwould be incapable of knowing the physical effects of his act.120. The accused had\\nkilled his wife and his minor children and assaulted his neighbour and the police oﬃcer.\\nThe evidence showed that he had a history of insanity with at random assault on\\nstrangers but his relations with his wife were cordial. It was held that the accused was\\na man of unsound mind and his conviction under sections 302, 332 and 323 was set\\naside.121. The accused caught hold of the legs of a girl of two years of age on the road\\nand struck her on the ground. She sustained head injury and died in the hospital. On the\\nbasis of the ocular evidence about the conduct of the accused at the time of the\\noffence and the opinion of the doctor about his state of mind, the accused was\\nacquitted on the ground of insanity.122. The accused, a labourer, killed his brother's wife\\nand attempted to kill his mother in a quarrel over money deposited with his mother.\\nAccused assaulted with axe on the vital parts of the victim's body, absconded for three\\nmonths and immediately after the incident worked as a labourer in another village for\\n15 days. It was held that the conduct of the accused immediately before, at the time of\\nand after the incident, was wholly inconsistent with the plea of insanity raised by him.\\nThe history of earlier mental derangement was not by itself suﬃcient to bring the case\\nwithin section 84.123. Where on the day of the crime the accused was seen dancing\\nwith a dog on his head and with a broken bottle, but the medical evidence showed that\\nhe was a normal man, it was held that defence of insanity was an afterthought.124. The\\nmere fact that the accused attempted to escape from the scene of occurrence after\\nkilling his wife, belied his plea of insanity.125. Where a father and his relatives sacriﬁced\\na four-year-old son to propitiate the deity, the Supreme Court held that this does not by\\nitself constitute insanity. Such primitive and inhuman actions must be punished\\nseverely so as to deter others from resorting to such barbaric practices.126.\"), ('84.5', 'Partial delusion.—\\nMere abnormality of mind or partial delusion affords no protection under section 84\\nIPC, 1860.127. Whether a person who, under an insane delusion as to the existing facts,\\ncommits an offence in consequence thereof, is to be, therefore, excused depends upon\\nthe nature of the delusion. If he labours under a partial delusion only, and is not in other\\nrespects insane, he must be considered in the same situation as to responsibility as if\\nthe facts, with respect to which the delusion exists, were real.128. If a person aﬄicted\\nwith insane delusion, in respect of one or more particular subjects or persons, commits\\na crime, knowing that he was acting contrary to law, but did the act complained of with\\na view, under the inﬂuence of insane delusion, of redressing or revenging some\\nsupposed grievance or injury, or of producing some public beneﬁt, he is nevertheless\\npunishable according to the nature of the crime committed.129. Where the accused\\nafter killing his daughter tried to commit suicide and there was no evidence of\\npsychiatric treatment but only major depression, he was held liable to be convicted.130.\\nconscious that an act was done which he ought not to do and if the act was at the\\nsame time contrary to the law of the land, he is punishable. His liability will not be\\ndiminished if he did the act complained of with a view under the inﬂuence of insane\\ndelusion of redressing or revenging some supposed grievance or injury or of producing\\nsome public beneﬁt, if he knew that he was acting contrary to law.131. Where the\\naccused, a young man, took a girl of four years on a bicycle to a lonely place near a\\ncanal, sexually assaulted her and threw her into the canal, it was held that it was a\\ncarefully thought out action and not an act of an insane person.132.\\nMere absence of motive for a crime, howsoever atrocious it may be, cannot, in the\\nabsence of plea and proof of legal insanity, bring the case within this section.133. The\\nmere fact that an act of murder is committed by the accused on a sudden impulse and\\nthere is no discoverable motive for the act will not generally afford the Court suﬃcient\\nbasis for accepting the plea of insanity.134. Thus, in SW Mohammed\\'s case the\\nSupreme Court held that the mere fact that no motive has been proved why the\\naccused murdered his wife and child or the fact that he made no attempt to run away\\nwhen the door was broken open would not indicate that he was insane or that he did\\nnot have the necessary mens rea for the offence.135. In a Madras case, however, the\\nMadras High Court has held that where the accused was insane for some months prior\\nto occurrence and on cordial terms with his wife but suddenly killed the wife in the\\nopen courtyard without any ostensible motive and did not even attempt to run away or\\nsecret his crime, he had to be given the beneﬁt of section 84, IPC, 1860.136. This case\\ncan, of course, be distinguished from the above mentioned Supreme Court case on the\\nground that in the instant case the accused had previous history of insanity which was\\nnot fully cured. Prior or subsequent treatment for schizophrenia coupled with the\\nevidence of the doctor that the accused was schizophrenic would entitle the accused\\nto the beneﬁt of section 84 in a charge of murder.137. But where the doctor in his\\nevidence merely said unsoundness of mind may have existed from before and that\\nevidence was contradicted by evidence of close relations about sanity of the accused\\nat the time of the occurrence, it was held that the accused could not get the beneﬁt of\\nsection 84, IPC, 1860.138. There is a difference between medical insanity and legal\\ninsanity. By medical insanity is meant the prisoner\\'s consciousness of the bearing of\\nhis act on those affected by it and by legal insanity is meant the prisoner\\'s\\nconsciousness in relation to himself.139. There can be no legal insanity unless the\\ncognitive faculties of the accused are as a result of unsoundness of mind completely\\nimpaired. In order to constitute legal insanity unsoundness of mind must be such as to\\nmake the offender incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what\\nis wrong or contrary to law.140. Thus, mere abnormality of mind or partial delusion,\\nirresistible impulse or compulsive behaviour of a psychopath affords no protection\\nunder section 84 of the IPC, 1860 as the law contained in that section is still squarely\\nbased on the outdated M\\'Naughten Rules of 19th Century England. Thus, in\\nSiddheswari\\'s case141. where the accused killed her ailing child of three and there was\\nalso some evidence elicited in cross-examination to show that the accused had\\nsuffered from some mental derangement two years prior to the incident, it was held\\nthat the mere fact the murder was committed on a sudden impulse or as a \"mercy\\nkilling\" was no ground to give her the beneﬁt of section 84 IPC, 1860, even though both\\neuthanasia (mercy killing) and irresistible impulse would entitle the accused in England\\nto get the beneﬁt of diminished responsibility and her crime would be treated as\\nmanslaughter (i.e. culpable homicide not amounting to murder). In a latter case too the\\nGauhati High Court felt that where the accused has made out a prima facie case of\\nirresistible impulse the plea has to be taken into consideration in deciding the question\\nof giving beneﬁt of section 84, IPC, 1860, to the accused.142.\\nThe position, however, has undergone a sea change in England where the right or\\nwrong test of the M\\'Naughten Rules no longer dominate this branch of criminal law to\\nthe exclusion of mental abnormality falling short of complete insanity as a limited\\ndefence establishing a claim to diminished responsibility. Thus, under section 2 of the\\nHomicide Act, 1957 if two Psychiatrists certify that the homicidal act of the accused\\nwas inﬂuenced by abnormal condition of his mind though not amounting to legal\\ninsanity within the meaning of M\\'Naughten Rules, still he cannot be convicted of\\nmurder but his offence will be regarded only as a manslaughter which is equivalent to\\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder under the IPC, 1860. It is hoped that the\\nIndian law too would be changed on this score with due regard to the modern\\ndevelopments in the ﬁeld of psychology of criminal behaviour.'), ('84.6', \"CASES.—\\nAccused, who was a mentally challenged person before the incident, killed three\\npersons and caused injuries to others with an axe. He did not know the implication of\\nhis act and indiscriminately went on wielding axe blows, be it a child or a woman and\\nthere after he did not even attempt to hide the weapon which he used for committing\\ncrime. He was found of unsound mind in his medical examination. Case of accused\\ncomes within the four corners of section 84 IPC, 1860.143. Where an accused, who was\\nsuffering from fever which caused him while suffering from its paroxysms to be\\nbewildered and unconscious, killed his children at being annoyed at their crying, but he\\nwas not delirious then, and there was no evidence to show that he was not conscious\\nof the nature of his act, it was held that he was not entitled to protection under this\\nsection.144. But where the accused labouring under a delusion believed his two-month-\\nold infant child to be a devil and danger to himself, his family and to the whole world\\nand, therefore, killed the child with unusual ferocity almost reducing it to a pulp and\\nthereafter without making any attempt to escape told the police party that he had\\nremoved a devil from the world, it was held that the accused did not know that what he\\nhad done was wrong and as such was entitled to get protection of section 84, IPC,\\n1860, even when he did not plead insanity in his defence as the prosecution itself\\ndisclosed that he was insane.145.

Medical evidence shows that the\\naccused was suffering from schizophrenia. Accused was reticent by nature and used\\nto keep himself indoors and interact only when he was compelled to do so. He was not\\nin a normal state of mind at the time of alleged crime. Appellant is entitled to the\\nbeneﬁts under section 84 of IPC, 1860.146. The accused killed three persons and\\ncaused injuries to others and there was no previous enmity or motive established. The\\nwitnesses stated that he ran from one place to other and on his way he assaulted ﬁve\\npersons indiscriminately without any rhyme or reason. The evidence shows that\\nappellant had developed insanity since long and entitled to the beneﬁt of this\\nsection.147. Accused chopped off his wife's head, with a chopper. After the occurrence,\\nin a very unusual and abnormal manner, holding the head and the chopper in each of\\nhis hands, he walked down the road and ultimately reached the police station. Though\\nthis, by itself, would not be suﬃcient to come to any conclusion but taken along with\\nthe other circumstances of the case would clearly point to the validity of the defence\\nput forward on behalf of the accused.148.\"), ('84.7', 'Epilepsy, Epileptic ﬁts and Section 84.—\\nEpilepsy usually occurs from early infancy, though it may occur at any period of life.\\nIndividuals, who have had epileptic ﬁts for years, do not necessarily show any mental\\naberration, but quite a few of them suffer from mental deterioration.

From this, an inference can reasonably be drawn that the\\naccused was under paranoid delusions at the time that he committed the offence.161.'), ('84.13', 'Burden of proof.—\\nThe Supreme Court deﬁned the doctrine of burden of proof in the context of the plea of\\ninsanity in the following propositions:-\\n\"(1) The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had\\ncommitted the offence with the requisite mens rea; and the burden of proving\\nthat always rests on the prosecution from the beginning to the end of the trial.\\n(2) There is a rebuttable presumption that the appellant was not insane, when he\\ncommitted the crime, in the sense laid down by section 84 of the IPC, 1860: the\\nappellant may rebut it by placing before the court all the relevant evidence - oral,\\ndocumentary or circumstantial, but the burden of proof upon him is no higher\\nthan that rests upon a party to civil proceedings.\\n(3) Even if the appellant was not able to establish conclusively that he was insane\\nat the time he committed the offence, the evidence placed before the court by\\nthe appellant or by the prosecution may raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of\\nthe court as regards one or more of the ingredients of the offence, including\\nmens rea of the appellant and in that case the court would be entitled to acquit\\nthe appellant on the ground that the general burden of proof resting on the\\nprosecution was not discharged\".162.\\nIt has been held that merely because an injured witness, who may legitimately be\\nclassiﬁed as an interested witness for obvious reasons, may have stated that the\\nappellant was not of unsound mind, cannot absolve the primary duty of the prosecution\\nto establish its case beyond all reasonable doubt explaining why the plea for\\nunsoundness of mind taken by the accused was untenable.163.\\nThe burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the\\npurview of section 84 lies upon the accused under section 105 of the Indian Evidence\\nAct. Under the said section, the Court shall presume the absence of such\\ncircumstances.164. But the burden on the accused cannot be equivalent with the\\nburden of proof on the prosecution and cannot be rated higher than the burden on a\\nparty to a civil proceeding where a ﬁnding can be based upon preponderance of\\nprobabilities. There is no conﬂict between the general burden which is always on the\\nprosecution and which never shifts and the special burden which rests on the accused\\nto make out the defence of insanity.165. Sometimes the facts may in themselves be\\nsuﬃcient to discharge the burden which lies on the accused. This possibility was\\nrecognised by the Supreme Court in Ratan Lal v State of MP.166. The accused-appellant\\nwas kept in police custody for ten days and only then it was felt that he needed medical\\nexamination. There was no evidence on record to show what his condition was during\\nthose ten days and why he was not examined earlier. This conduct on the part of the\\npolice, neither to arrange his examination nor permit him to do so, brought about such\\na gap of time between the incident and examination that his condition at the time of\\nthe incident was no longer capable of being precisely determined. As against this\\npolice inaction, the defence pointed towards the conduct of the accused before the\\nincident and some statements of witnesses which supported the instable condition of\\nthe accused. This was held to be suﬃcient to discharge the burden which lies on the\\naccused and his acquittal was upheld by the Supreme Court. Going by this case in\\nTukappa Tamanna Lingardi v State of Maharashtra,167. the Bombay High Court found\\nevidence of insanity from a narration of the facts themselves. Mere oral statements of\\nwitnesses cannot give rise to an inference that the appellant was of unsound mind at\\nthe time of commission of offence. Plea of the accused does not come within\\nexception contemplated under section 84 of IPC, 1860.168. IPC, 1860\\nWhere there was no satisfactory evidence of the previous history of the accused or his\\nsubsequent conduct and the only fact on record was that ghastly murders were\\ncommitted without motive, it was held that the burden of proof as to plea of insanity\\nwas not discharged. However, because of the absence of motive, premeditation and\\nany weapon, killings being done with stone pieces, death sentence was converted into\\nlife imprisonment.169. Where, on the other hand, a father killed his son and then danced\\naround, moving towards his house threatening others, facts spoke for themselves so\\nas to discharge the burden of proof as to insanity, the accused was acquitted and\\nordered to be detained in a mental home.170.\\nMere eccentric behaviour, like drowning one\\'s own two and a half-year-old child to\\ndeath, does not discharge this burden which is essentially on the accused and requires\\nhim to show all the ingredients of the defence to the extent at least of making them\\nprobable at the time of the commission of the act. Previous history and subsequent\\nconduct are only relevant facts in the determination of the condition at the material\\ntime.171.\\nThe mere absence of motive is not suﬃcient to bring the case within the scope of\\nsection 84.172.'), ('84.14', 'Sentencing.—\\nThe accused was charged with offences under sections 427, 302, 307, 451, etc.\\nMedical evidence showed that he was a person of unsound mind at the time when the\\noffences were committed.

She\\nwas a young woman aged 20. She began a sexual relationship with the deceased when\\nshe was 14 and began to live with him when she was 16. She had a miscarriage and on\\ntwo occasions took overdoses. The deceased became violent towards her two or three\\ntimes each week. She sought psychiatric help and on two occasions came to the\\nattention of the police. In 1998 she decided to end the relationship and there was an\\nargument which developed into a ﬁght. She picked up a knife and waved it at the\\ndeceased, telling him to leave. There was a further struggle during the course of which\\nthe deceased received a fatal knife wound to his back. She immediately shouted for\\nhelp and was found in an extremely distressed condition. When she was examined, she\\nwas found to be extensively bruised. A psychiatrist who examined her found that she\\nexhibited a number of features of the \"battered woman\\'s syndrome\", including chronic\\ndepressive illness, a feeling of hopelessness and despair, and inability to act effectively\\nor to see an escape from her situation, and feelings of self-blame, shame and a poor\\nsense of self-worth. A second psychiatrist found a degree of clinical depression which\\namounted to abnormality of mind. She was sentenced to four years\\' detention in a\\nyoung offender institution. Her appeal against the sentence was allowed. In the light of\\nthe evidence, the Court reached the conclusion that there were in the present case\\nthose exceptional circumstances which would allow the Court to take the unusual\\ncourse of passing a sentence other than custody. The accused woman had been\\nsubject from a young age to persistent and prolonged violence from a man older than\\nherself who was domineering and demanding. Since her arrest she had made\\nremarkable progress, and a custodial sentence would be likely to damage and possibly\\nbring to an end that rehabilitation. She had served the equivalent of a sentence of 12\\nmonths and it was appropriate to give her the opportunity to continue her progress.

The law pronounces that the obscuration and divestment of that\\njudgment and human feeling which in a sober state would have prevented the accused\\nfrom offending, shall not, when produced by his voluntary act, screen him from\\npunishment, although he be no longer capable of self-restraint.188. It is also no excuse\\nto say that because of it he failed to resist the impulse to act in a certain way189. or\\nthat because of it he acted like an automaton.190.'), ('85.1', 'Voluntary drunkenness.—when an excuse.—\\nNevertheless voluntary drunkenness is a factor which has to be taken into\\nconsideration at least in two types of cases, viz.,\\n(i) where a speciﬁc intent is an essential element of an offence charged and the\\nevidence shows that the state of intoxication of the accused is such that he is\\nincapable of forming the speciﬁc intent essential to constitute the crime.191. In the\\nIndian context, for example, it would be intent to kill as in clauses 1, 2, and 3 of section\\n300, IPC, 1860. In such cases, however, even if the accused fails to actually form the\\nspeciﬁc intent, section 86, IPC, 1860, would impute the necessary guilty knowledge to\\nhim and he would, therefore, be liable for culpable homicide not amounting to murder\\nthough not of murder.192. Thus, voluntary intoxication amounting to prove incapacity to\\nform the required speciﬁc intent would be a limited excuse to reduce an offence of\\nmurder (section 302) to one of culpable homicide not amounting murder (section 304,\\nIPC, 1860). This is, however, a question of fact in each case.\\nIn a case of wife-burning, her dying declaration disclosed that her husband consumed\\nliquor, scolded her and then set her aﬁre after pouring kerosene on her. She fought the\\nﬁre and tried to run away but the accused again caught hold of her and again poured oil\\nand inﬂamed her. It was held that these circumstances showed that the mental\\nfaculties of the accused were not impaired to such an extent that he was prevented\\nfrom forming the requisite intention to cause death. He was convicted under section\\n302 and not section 304, Part II.193.\\n(ii) where habitual drunkenness has resulted in such a diseased condition of the mind\\nthat the accused is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he is doing what\\nis either wrong or contrary to law.

The most\\ncommon example of such an alcoholic disease is \"Delirium Tremens\" which is\\nproduced by prolonged and habitual excessive drinking and results in loss of the\\nfaculty of reasoning or serious defect of reasoning. In other words, \"insanity, whether\\nproduced by drunkenness or otherwise, is a defence to the crime charged.\"195.\\nUnder this section if a man is made drunk through stratagem or the fraud of others, or\\nthrough ignorance, or through any other means causing intoxication without the man\\'s\\nknowledge or against his will, he is excused.196.'), ('85.2', 'CASE.—\\nThe accused ravished a girl of 13 years of age and, in furtherance of the act of rape,\\nplaced his hand upon her mouth and his thumb upon her throat, thereby causing death\\nby suffocation.

      "[('86', 'Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one\\nwho is intoxicated.\\nIn cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge\\nor intent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt\\nwith as if he had the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been\\nintoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without\\nhis knowledge or against his will.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nOffence requiring particular intent or knowledge.—By reading the above section, it is\\nclear that in the ﬁrst part of the section the words \\'intention or knowledge\\' are\\nmentioned, but in the latter part of the section the word \\'knowledge\\' is only mentioned\\nand the word \\'intention\\' is omitted. In case of voluntary drunkenness, knowledge is to\\nbe presumed in the same manner as if there was no drunkenness. If really the\\nParliament wanted the word \\'intention\\' also to be presumed even in the case of an act\\ndone in a drunken state of mind, the said word could have been mentioned in the\\nSecond part also, but the same is omitted. Therefore, whether the accused was having\\nintention or not while committing an act cannot be presumed as in case of\\nknowledge.199. As certain guilty knowledge or intention forms part of the deﬁnition of\\nmany offences, this section is provided to meet those cases. It says that a person\\nvoluntarily intoxicated will be deemed to have the same knowledge as he would have\\nhad if he had not been intoxicated. There may be cases in which a particular knowledge\\nis an ingredient, and there may be other cases in which a particular intent is an\\ningredient, the two not being necessarily always identical. The section does not say\\nthat the accused shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same intention as\\nmight have been presumed if he had not been intoxicated. Therefore, although there is\\na presumption so far as knowledge is concerned, there is no such presumption with\\nregard to intention.200. Thus, this section attributes to a drunken man the knowledge of\\na sober man when judging of his action but does not give him the same intention. This\\nknowledge is the result of a legal ﬁction and constructive intention cannot invariably be\\nraised.201. Drunkenness makes no difference to the knowledge with which a man is\\ncredited and if a man knew what the natural consequences of his acts were, he must\\nbe presumed to have intended to cause them.202. But this presumption may be\\nrebutted by his showing that at the time he did the act, his mind was so affected by the\\ndrink he had taken that he was incapable of forming the intention requisite for making\\nhis act the offence charged against him.203.\\nSo far as knowledge is concerned the Court must attribute to the intoxicated man the\\nsame knowledge as if he was quite sober but so far as intent or intention is concerned,\\nthe Court must gather it from the attending general circumstances of the case paying\\ndue regard to the degree of intoxication. If the man was beside his mind altogether for\\nthe time being, it would not be possible to ﬁx him with the requisite intention. In other\\nwords, where a man goes so deep into drinking that he becomes really incapable of\\nforming the requisite speciﬁc intent or knowledge for the offence, then in such a case\\ntoo section 86 of the Code would impute the requisite knowledge to the accused\\nthough not the requisite intention. Thus, where the accused in a state of extreme\\nintoxication caused a fatal injury in the abdomen of his friend but by virtue of his highly\\nintoxicated state of mind was incapable of knowing then as to what he was doing far\\nless forming the requisite intent to kill as envisaged in section 300, IPC, 1860, he could\\nnot be convicted under section 302 as he did not have the requisite intent to kill but he\\ncould still be convicted under section 304 Part II, IPC, 1860, by virtue of imputed\\nknowledge under section 86, IPC, 1860.204. In this connection see also the discussion\\nunder sub-head \"voluntary drunkenness: when an excuse\" under section 85, ante. But if\\nhe had not gone so deep in drinking and from the facts it could be found that he knew\\nwhat he was about the Court will apply the rule that a man is presumed to intend the\\nnatural consequences of his act or acts.205.\\n2004 Cr LJ 1778 : (2005) 9 SCC 71 [LNIND 2004 SC 1370] .'), ('86.1', 'CASES.—\\nAccused husband beating his wife and throwing burning lamp on her under inﬂuence of\\nliquor. Since he himself consumed the liquor he is not entitled to claim beneﬁt under\\nsection 86 of IPC, 1860.206. Act of the accused of walking a distance to the house of a\\nwitness and concealing the weapon and his wearing apparels showed that he was\\nconscious and capable of understanding of his act. No evidence as regards the degree\\nof intoxication or any evidence of any attending general circumstances to arrive at a\\nconclusion that accused was beside his mind altogether temporarily at time\\nincident.207. On the basis of evidence in this case, it cannot be said that the accused\\nwas so much intoxicated at the time of the incident that he was beside his mind\\naltogether for the time being. He did set his wife on ﬁre, but as soon as her sari started\\nburning he realised the folly of his act and started extinguishing the ﬁre. It shows that\\nhe was not so much intoxicated that he was besides his mind altogether. Therefore, the\\nrule that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act can be\\napplied to him also. Conviction under section 302 IPC, 1860 altered to one under\\nsection 304(1) IPC, 1860.208.'), ('86.2', 'Sections 85 and 86.—\\nThe reading of sections 85 and 86 together makes it clear that section 86 is an\\nexception to section 85. These provisions show that if the intoxication is induced\\nvoluntarily, the act done is an offence even if the person is incapable of knowing the\\nnature of the act or that what he is doing is either wrong or contrary to law. This section\\nobviously covers all offences. That is why; it appears that it became necessary to enact\\nsection 86 to take care of offences requiring a particular intent or knowledge on the\\npart of the intoxicated offender. The section takes care of such offences and states\\nthat if intoxication is involuntary, neither knowledge nor intention in committing the\\noffence will be presumed. If however, it is voluntary only knowledge of the offence on\\nthe part of the offender will be presumed but not intention in committing it. What\\nsection 86 means and no more as compared to section 85. The degree of intoxication\\ndemanded by both sections, however, remains the same.

Consent means an active will in the mind\\nof a person to permit the doing of the act complained of, and knowledge of what is to\\nbe done, or of the nature of the act that is being done, is essential to consent to an\\nact.223. An act of helplessness on the face of inevitable compulsions is not consent in\\nlaw.224. It requires voluntary participation by victim not only after exercise of\\nintelligence based on knowledge of signiﬁcance and moral quality of act, but after\\nhaving fully exercised the choice between resistance and assent.225. A mere act of\\nhelpless resignation in the face of inevitable compulsion, non-resistance and passive\\ngiving in cannot be deemed to be consent.226. The Supreme Court in a long line of\\ncases has given wider meaning to the word 'consent' in the context of sexual offences\\nas explained in various judicial dictionaries. In Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law\\n(Second Edn), vol (1) 1977 at p 422 the word 'consent' has been explained as an act of\\nreason accompanied with deliberation, the mind weighing, as in a balance, the good or\\nevil on either side. It is further stated that consent supposes three things–a physical\\npower, a mental power, and a free and serious use of them and if consent be obtained\\nby intimidation, force, meditated imposition, circumvention, surprise, or undue\\ninﬂuence, it is to be treated as a delusion, and not as a deliberate and free act of the\\nmind.227. Section 90 cannot be considered as an exhaustive deﬁnition of consent for\\nthe purposes of IPC, 1860. The normal connotation and concept of consent is not\\nintended to be excluded.228. For determining whether consent given by the prosecutrix\\nwas voluntary or under a misconception of fact, no straitjacket formula can be laid\\ndown.229.\\nThe factors set out in the ﬁrst part are from the point of view of the victim. The second\\npart enacts the corresponding provision from the point of view of the accused. It\\nenvisages that the accused too has the knowledge or reason to believe that the\\nconsent was given by the victim in consequence of fear of injury or misconception of\\nfact. The requirements of both the parts have to be cumulatively satisﬁed.230.\\nSubmission of the body under the fear of terror cannot be construed as a consented\\nsexual act. Consent for the purpose of section 375 requires voluntary participation not\\nonly after the exercise of intelligence based on the knowledge of the signiﬁcance and\\nmoral quality of the act but after having fully exercised the choice between resistance\\nand assent. Whether there was consent or not, is to be ascertained only on a careful\\nstudy of all relevant circumstances.231. Consent can be obtained under various\\nmethods and always necessarily need not be a one which is given voluntarily. For\\nexample, if a victim is intoxicated without her knowledge or consent and if the rape is\\ncommitted while the victim was intoxicated or drunken, it cannot be said that she had\\nvoluntarily given the consent. Therefore, such passive consent cannot be treated as a\\nconsent as contemplated by section 90 of IPC, 1860.232. Obtaining consent by\\nexercising deceit cannot be legitimate defence to exculpate an accused.233.\"), ('90.1', 'Submission to Rape.—\\nAn act of submission does not involve consent- Consent cannot be equated to inability\\nto resist or helplessness.234. Every consent involves a submission, but every\\nsubmission is not consent and the mere fact that a woman had submitted to the\\npromise of the accused does not necessarily indicate that her consent existed unless\\nthe evidence on record establishes that the sexual act, which the prosecutrix had\\nallowed, was accompanied with deliberation after the mind had weighed, as in a\\nbalance, the good and the evil on each side with the existing capacity and power to\\nwithdraw the assent according to one\\'s will or pleasure.235. Where, the accused had\\nsexual intercourse with the prosecutrix by giving false assurance to her that he would\\nmarry her and when she became pregnant, he refused to do so, it was evident that he\\nnever intended to marry her and procured her consent only for the reason of having\\nsexual relations with her, therefore, the act of the accused fell squarely under the\\ndeﬁnition of rape as her consent was obtained under a misconception of fact.236.\\nenough to include all cases where the consent is obtained by misrepresentation; the\\nmisrepresentation should be regarded as leading to a misconception of the facts with\\nreference to which the consent is given. In section 3 of the Evidence Act Illustration (d)\\nstates that a person has a certain intention is treated as a fact. So, here the fact about\\nwhich the second and third prosecution witnesses were made to entertain a\\nmisconception was the fact that the second accused intended to get the girl married...\\n\"thus... if the consent of the person from whose possession the girl is taken is obtained\\nby fraud, the taking is deemed to be against the will of such a person…\" Although in\\ncases of contracts a consent obtained by coercion or fraud is only voidable by the party\\naffected by it, the effect of section 90 IPC, 1860 is that such consent cannot, under the\\ncriminal law, be availed of to justify what would otherwise be an offence.237. Consent\\nmay be express or implied, coerced or misguided, obtained willingly or through deceit.\\nConsent is an act of reason, accompanied by deliberation, the mind weighing, as in a\\nbalance, the good and evil on each side. There is a clear distinction between rape and\\nconsensual sex and in a case like this, the Court must very carefully examine whether\\nthe accused had actually wanted to marry the victim, or had mala ﬁde motives, and had\\nmade a false promise to this effect only to satisfy his lust, as the latter falls within the\\nambit of cheating or deception. There is a distinction between the mere breach of a\\npromise, and not fulﬁlling a false promise. Thus, the Court must examine whether there\\nwas made, at an early stage a false promise of marriage by the accused; and whether\\nthe consent involved was given after wholly, understanding the nature and\\nconsequences of sexual indulgence. There may be a case where the prosecutrix agrees\\nto have sexual intercourse on account of her love and passion for the accused, and not\\nsolely on account of misrepresentation made to her by the accused, or where an\\naccused on account of circumstances which he could not have foreseen, or which were\\nbeyond his control, was unable to marry her, despite having every intention to do so.\\nSuch cases must be treated differently. An accused can be convicted for rape only if\\nthe Court reaches a conclusion that the intention of the accused was mala ﬁde, and\\nthat he had clandestine motives.238. In order to come within the meaning of\\nmisconception of fact, the fact must have an immediate relevance. If a fully grown-up\\ngirl consents to the act of sexual intercourse on a promise of marriage and continues\\nto indulge in such activity until she becomes pregnant, it is an act of promiscuity on her\\npart and not an act induced by misconception of fact and it was held that section 90\\nIPC, 1860 cannot be invoked unless the Court can be assured that from the inception\\nthe accused never intended to marry her. Therefore, it depends on case to case that\\nwhat is the evidence led in the matter. If it is a fully grown-up girl who gave the consent\\nthen it is a different case but a girl whose age is very tender and she is giving a consent\\nafter persuasion of three months on the promise that the accused will marry her which\\nhe never intended to fulﬁl right from the beginning which is apparent from the conduct\\nof the accused, in our opinion, section 90 can be invoked.239. A promise to marry\\nwithout anything more will not give rise to \"misconception of fact\" within the meaning\\nof section 90, it needs to be clariﬁed that a representation deliberately made by the\\naccused with a view to elicit the assent of the victim without having the intention or\\ninclination to marry her, will vitiate the consent. If on the facts it is established that at\\nthe very inception of the making of promise, the accused did not really entertain the\\nintention of marrying her and the promise to marry held out by him was a mere hoax,\\nthe consent ostensibly given by the victim will be of no avail to the accused to\\nexculpate him from the ambit of section 375 clause second.240.'), ('90.2', 'CASES.—\\nThe prosecutrix had sexual intercourse with the accused on the representation made\\nby the accused that he would marry her. This was a false promise held out by the\\naccused. Had this promise not been given perhaps, she would not have permitted the\\naccused to have sexual intercourse. It appears that the intention of the accused was,\\nright from the beginning, not honest and he kept on promising that he will marry her, till\\nshe became pregnant. This kind of consent obtained by the accused cannot be said to\\nbe any consent because she was under a misconception of fact that the accused\\nintends to marry her, therefore, she had submitted to sexual intercourse with him.241. In\\nUday v State of Karnataka,242. the Court considered the following facts: (i) where a girl\\nwas of 19 years of age and had suﬃcient intelligence to understand the signiﬁcance\\nand moral quality of the act she was consenting to; (ii) she was conscious of the fact\\nthat her marriage was diﬃcult on account of caste considerations; (iii) it was diﬃcult to\\nimpute to the appellant, knowledge that the prosecutrix had consented in consequence\\nof a misconception of the fact arising from his promise; and (iv) there was no evidence\\nto prove conclusively that the appellant never intended to marry the prosecutrix. On the\\nbasis of the above factors, Court held that it did not feel persuaded to hold that consent\\nwas obtained by misconception of facts on the part of the victim.\\nIn a case, the prosecutrix had left her home voluntarily, of her own free will to get\\nmarried to the accused.

The surgeon is not the patient's guardian, and has no\\nauthority from any such guardian, yet it is evident that the surgeon ought not to be\\npunished. Again, a house is on ﬁre.

      "[('96', 'Things done in private defence.\\nNothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nIn a civilised society the defence of person and property of every member thereof is the\\nresponsibility of the State. Consequently, there is a duty cast on every person faced\\nwith apprehension of imminent danger of his person or property to seek the aid of the\\nmachinery provided by the State but if immediately such aid is not available, he has the\\nright of private defence. Right to private defence is a very valuable right and it has been\\nrecognized in all civilized and democratic societies within certain reasonable limits.\\nSections 96–106 of IPC, 1860 codify the entire law relating to right of private defence\\nof person and property including the extent of and the limitation to exercise of such\\nright. When enacting sections 96 to 106 of the IPC, 1860, excepting from its penal\\nprovisions, certain classes of acts, done in good faith for the purpose of repelling\\nunlawful aggressions, the Legislature clearly intended to arouse and encourage the\\nmanly spirit of self-defence amongst the citizens, when faced with grave danger.269.'), ('96.1', \"Principle.—\\nThe basic principle underlying the doctrine of the right of private defence is that when\\nan individual or his property is faced with a danger and immediate aid from the State\\nmachinery is not readily available, that individual is entitled to protect himself and his\\nproperty.270. The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly\\nconfronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation.\\nThat being so, the necessary corollary is that the violence which the citizen defending\\nhimself or his property is entitled to use must not be unduly disproportionate to the\\ninjury which is sought to be averted or which is reasonably apprehended and should\\nnot exceed its legitimate purpose. The law does not require a law abiding citizen to\\nbehave like a coward when confronted with an imminent unlawful aggression. There is\\nnothing more degrading to the human spirit than to run away in face of danger. The\\nright of private defence is thus, designed to serve a social purpose and deserves to be\\nfostered within the prescribed limits. The IPC, 1860 deﬁnes homicide in self-defence as\\na form of substantive right, and therefore, save and except the restrictions imposed on\\nthe right of the Code itself, it seems that the special rule of English Law as to the duty\\nof retreating will have no application to this country where there is a real need for\\ndefending oneself against deadly assaults. The right to protect one's own person and\\nproperty against the unlawful aggressions of others is a right inherent in man. The duty\\nof protecting the person and property of others is a duty which man owes to society of\\nwhich he is a member and the preservation of which is both his interest and duty. It is,\\nindeed, a duty which ﬂows from human sympathy.\\nAs Bentham said:\\nIt is a noble movement of the heart, that indignation which kindles at the sight of the feeble\\ninjured by the strong. It is noble movement which makes us forget our danger at the ﬁrst cry\\nof distress..... It concerns the public safety that every honest man should consider himself\\nas the natural protector of every other.\\nBut such protection must not be extended beyond the necessities of the case;\\notherwise it will encourage a spirit or lawlessness and disorder. The right has,\\ntherefore, been restricted to offences against the human body and those relating to\\naggression on property. Right of private defence of person and property is recognized\\nin all free, civilised, democratic societies within certain reasonable limits. Those limits\\nare dictated by two considerations: (1) that the same right is claimed by all other\\nmembers of the society and (2) that it is the State which generally undertakes the\\nresponsibility for the maintenance of law and order. The citizens, as a general rule, are\\nneither expected to run away for safety when faced with grave and imminent danger to\\ntheir person or property as a result of unlawful aggression, nor are they expected, by\\nuse of force, to right the wrong done to them or to punish the wrong doer of\\ncommission of offences.271.\"), ('96.2', 'Scope.—\\nSection 96 IPC, 1860 provides that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise\\nof the right of private defence. The section does not deﬁne the expression \"right of\\nprivate defence\". It merely indicates that nothing is an offence which is done in the\\nexercise of such right.272. While providing for exercise of the right, care has been taken\\nin IPC, 1860 not to provide and has not devised a mechanism whereby an attack may\\nbe a pretence for killing. A right to defend does not include a right to launch an\\noffensive, particularly when the need to defend no longer survived.273. Just because\\none circumstance exists amongst the various factors, which appears to favour the\\nperson claiming right of self-defence, does not mean that he gets the right to cause the\\ndeath of the other person. Even the right of self-defence has to be exercised directly in\\nproportion to the extent of aggression.274.'), ('96.3', \"Test.—\\nWhether in a particular set of circumstances, a person legitimately acted in the\\nexercise of the right of private defence is a question of fact to be determined on the\\nfacts and circumstances of each case. No test in the abstract for determining such a\\nquestion can be laid down. In determining this question of fact, the Court must\\nconsider all the surrounding circumstances. It is not necessary for the accused to\\nplead in so many words that he acted in self-defence. If the circumstances show that\\nthe right of private defence was legitimately exercised, it is open to the Court to\\nconsider such a plea.275. The means and the force a threatened person adopts at the\\nspur of the moment to ward off the danger and to save himself or his property cannot\\nbe weighed in golden scales. It is neither possible nor prudent to lay down abstract\\nparameters which can be applied to determine as to whether the means and force\\nadopted by the threatened person was proper or not. Answer to such a question\\ndepends upon host of factors like the prevailing circumstances at the spot; his feelings\\nat the relevant time; the confusion and the excitement depending on the nature of\\nassault on him etc. Nonetheless, the exercise of the right of private defence can never\\nbe vindictive or malicious. It would be repugnant to the very concept of private\\ndefence.276. A person who is apprehending death or bodily injury cannot weigh in\\ngolden scales in the spur of moment and in the heat of circumstances, the number of\\ninjuries required to disarm the assailants who were armed with weapons. In moments\\nof excitement and disturbed mental equilibrium it is often diﬃcult to expect the parties\\nto preserve composure and use exactly only so much force in retaliation\\ncommensurate with the danger apprehended to him where assault is imminent by use\\nof force, it would be lawful to repel the force in self-defence and the right of private\\ndefence commences, as soon as the threat becomes so imminent. Such situations\\nhave to be pragmatically viewed and not with high powered spectacles or microscopes\\nto detect slight or even marginal overstepping. Due weightage has to be given to, and\\nhyper technical approach has to be avoided in considering what happens on the spur of\\nthe moment on the spot and keeping in view normal human reaction and conduct,\\nwhere self-preservation is the paramount consideration. But, if the fact situation shows\\nthat in the guise of self-preservation, what really has been done is to assault the\\noriginal aggressor, even after the cause of reasonable apprehension has disappeared,\\nthe plea of right of private defence can legitimately be negatived. The Court dealing\\nwith the plea has to weigh the material to conclude whether the plea is acceptable. It is\\nessentially, as noted above, a ﬁnding of fact.277. Situations have to be judged from the\\nsubjective point of view of the accused concerned in the surrounding excitement and\\nconfusion of the moment, confronted with a situation of peril and not by any\\nmicroscopic and pedantic scrutiny. In adjudging the question as to whether more force\\nthan was necessary was used in the prevailing circumstances on the spot it would be\\ninappropriate, as held by this Court, to adopt tests by detached objectivity which would\\nbe so natural in a Court room, or that which would seem absolutely necessary to a\\nperfectly cool bystander. The person facing a reasonable apprehension of threat to\\nhimself cannot be expected to modulate his defence step-by-step with any arithmetical\\nexactitude of only that much which is required in the thinking of a man in ordinary\\ntimes or under normal circumstances.278.\\nMere use of abusive language does not give rise to private defence. Thus, where the\\ndeceased about a month before the murder had tried to outrage the modesty of the\\nwife of the accused and thereafter on the day of the incident cut a rustic joke enquiring\\nwhether the accused had not kept buffaloes for drinking milk which lead the accused\\nto beat the deceased mercilessly resulting in his death, it was held that giving the most\\ncharitable interpretation one could not ﬁnd a single circumstance which will give the\\naccused the beneﬁt of the right of private defence and the interval between the attempt\\nto outrage the modesty of the accused's wife and the murder being too long he was\\nalso not entitled to get the beneﬁt of grave and sudden provocation within the meaning\\nof exception 1 to section 300, IPC, 1860.279. Giving a general view of all the provisions\\non this right in Munney Khan v State,280. the Supreme Court observed:\\nThe right of private defence is codiﬁed in sections 96 to 106, IPC, which have all to be\\nread together in order to have a proper grasp of the scope and limitations of this right.\\nBy enacting the sections the authors of the Code wanted to except from the operation\\nof its penal clauses acts done in good faith for the purpose of repelling unlawful\\naggression.281.\\nSummary of Principles regarding Private defence\\n(i) Self-preservation is the basic human instinct and is duly recognized by the\\ncriminal jurisprudence of all civilized countries. All free, democratic and civilized\\ncountries recognize the right of private defence within certain reasonable limits.\\n(ii) The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted\\nwith the necessity of averting an impending danger and not of self-creation.\\n(iii) A mere reasonable apprehension is enough to put the right of self-defence into\\noperation. In other words, it is not necessary that there should be an actual\\ncommission of the offence in order to give rise to the right of private defence. It\\nis enough if the accused apprehended that such an offence is contemplated\\nand it is likely to be committed if the right of private defence is not exercised.\\n(iv) The right of private defence commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension\\narises and it is co-terminus with the duration of such apprehension.\\n(v) It is unrealistic to expect a person under assault to modulate his defence step by\\nstep with any arithmetical exactitude.\\n(vi) In private defence the force used by the accused ought not to be wholly\\ndisproportionate or much greater than necessary for protection of the person or\\nproperty.\\n(vii) It is well settled that even if the accused does not plead self-defence, it is open\\nto consider such a plea if the same arises from the material on record.\\n(viii) The accused need not prove the existence of the right of private defence\\nbeyond reasonable doubt.\\n(ix) The IPC, 1860 confers the right of private defence only when that unlawful or\\nwrongful act is an offence.\\n(x) A person who is in imminent and reasonable danger of losing his life or limb\\nmay in exercise of self-defence inﬂict any harm even extending to death on his\\nassailant either when the assault is attempted or directly threatened.\\n[Darshan Singh v State of Punjab.282.]\\nAll the sections would have to be read together to ascertain whether in the facts and\\ncircumstances of the case the accused were entitled to the defence or they exceeded\\nit. Only then one can get a comprehensive view of the scope and limitations of the\\nright.283.\\norder to ﬁnd whether right of private defence is available or not, the entire incident\\nmust be examined with care and viewed in its proper setting. The injuries received by\\nthe accused, the imminence of threat to his safety, the injuries caused by the accused\\nand the circumstances whether the accused had time to have recourse to public\\nauthorities are all relevant factors to be considered on a plea of private defence.284.\\nThe right of private defence is a defence right. It is neither a right of aggression nor a\\nright of reprisal. There is no right of private defence where there is no apprehension of\\ndanger. Right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted\\nwith the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation. The necessity\\nmust be a present necessity whether real or only apparent.285. It remains a question of\\nfact whether the right has been legitimately exercised.286. Thus, running to house,\\nfetching a sword and assaulting the deceased are by no means a matter of chance.\\nThese acts bear stamp of a design to kill and take the case out of the purview of\\nprivate defence.287. But where the accused was dispossessed of his land by a party of\\nmen and he ran to his residence from where he fetched his gun and came back within\\n15 minutes to ﬁre at and injure them, he was held to be within his rights, but when he\\nwent further still and chased and injured a person who was just standing by there and\\nwho died, in reference to him the accused had no right of private defence.288. Along\\nwith the above factors one has also to remember the following limitations on the right\\nof private defence of person or property:\\n(i) that if there is suﬃcient time for recourse to public authorities, the right are not\\navailable;\\n(ii) that more harm than that is necessary should not be caused;\\n(iii) that there must be a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt or hurt\\nto the person or damage to the property concerned.289. Where on account of\\nsome incident, the accused was confronted by three persons; it was held that\\nthe superiority in numbers in itself could in all probability have been construed\\nby the accused as an imminent danger to himself thus, giving him the signal to\\nact in exercise of the right of private defence.290.\\nThe need to act must not have been created by the conduct of the accused in the\\nimmediate context of the incident which was likely or intended to give rise to that\\nneed.291. The Supreme Court reiterated the various principles governing the law of\\nprivate defence and observed that it was essentially a defensive right and did not\\ninclude the right to launch an offensive attack, particularly when the need for defence\\nno longer existed.292. A right of private defence given by the Penal Code is essentially\\none of defence or self-protection and not a right of reprisal or punishment. It is subject\\nto the restrictions indicated in section 99 which are as important as the right itself.293.\"), ('96.4', 'CASES.—Plea of Private Defence rejected.—\\nAfter inﬂicting injuries on person of ﬁrst deceased, accused persons ran towards\\nsecond deceased, who was standing ten steps away from place of incident. Further\\nafter seeing incident relating to death of ﬁrst deceased, second deceased started\\nrunning towards Durga-ki-Dhani and was chased by accused persons and they inﬂicted\\nlathi blows on his person. Accused had no right to invoke right of self-defence by\\nchasing second deceased and to cause fatal injuries upon him.294. Where the accused\\nwere in fact the aggressors and being members of the aggressors party none of the\\naccused can claim right of self-defence.295. Merely because there was a quarrel and\\nsome of the accused person sustained injuries, that does not confer a right of private\\ndefence extending to the extent of causing death. It has to be established that the\\naccused person were under such grave apprehension about the safety of their life and\\nproperty that retaliation to the extent done was absolutely necessary. Right of private\\ndefence has been rightly discarded.296.\\nThe defence claimed that the place of occurrence was the house of the accused and,\\ntherefore, they had acted in self-defence but that was not proved through any leading\\nevidence despite the examination of the accused under section 313 of the Cr PC, 1973,\\nit was held that the right of self-defence was not available to them.297.'), ('96.5', 'Social nature of defence.—\\nThe right of private defence is not restricted to the particular person who is under\\nattack.

In determining what was reasonable force, which\\nin the Indian context means minimum force under section 99, IPC, 1860, the common\\nlaw Courts always insisted if the accused could prevent the commission of crime\\nagainst him by retreating. On this rule of retreat one would like to ask: if a person is\\nattacked by an armed burglar in his own room, he is expected to run away leaving the\\nburglar to act as he liked.302. In Jaidev's case303. Gajendragadkar, J, as he then was,\\nspeciﬁcally held that in India there is no rule which expects a man ﬁrst to run away or at\\nleast try to do so before he can exercise his right of private defence. Rather he has\\nevery right to stand his own ground and defend himself if there is no time to have\\nrecourse to oﬃcial help. Law does not expect a citizen to be a rank coward or leave his\\nown house at the mercy of the burglar.304. In spite of this clear exposition of the law in\\nJaidev's case Sarkaria, J, held in Yogendra Morarji's case305. that one must ﬁrst try to\\navoid the attack by retreating otherwise one would not be entitled to get the beneﬁt of\\nprivate defence. It appears that Jaidev's case was not canvassed before the learned\\njudges who decided the latter case. It is submitted with utmost respect that the former\\nview as held in Jaidev's case, appears to be more reasonable and has to be preferred.\\nindividual acts, normally no right of private defence is available to either party and they\\nwill be guilty of their respective acts.306. Where two parties come armed with\\ndetermination to measure their strength and to settle a dispute by force and in the\\nensuing ﬁght both sides receive injuries, no question of right of private defence arises.\\nIn such a case of free ﬁght both parties are aggressors and none of them can claim\\nright of private defence.307. In a free ﬁght between two groups resulting in the death of\\none and injuries to several others both grievous and simple, all the accused\\nparticipated in the ﬁght. The plea of one of the accused that he joined the ﬁght later\\nand acted in defence of other co-accused was held to be not tenable. The Court\\nobserved that his case could not be separated by giving him right of private defence\\nunder the beneﬁt of doubt.308. In a sudden ﬁght between two groups in heat of passion\\ndeath of a man was caused and several others on both the sides were injured. The\\ndeceased opened the assault ﬁrst. It was held that in such ﬁghts the question that\\nwhich party opened attack ﬁrst is immaterial. Plea of right of self-defence was not\\nallowed to the accused.309. Where two groups forming an unlawful assembly over the\\npossession of land in dispute which was in peaceful possession of neither group,\\nindulged in free ﬁght resulting in the death of two persons of a group, it was held that\\nright of private defence was not available to either group.310.\\nThe right to voluntary causing of death or any other harm is available against the\\nassailant and not against any other person.311.\\naccused by itself may not be suﬃcient to establish the right of private defence.312. The\\nnumber of injuries is not always considered to be a safe criterion for determining who\\nthe aggressor was. It can also not be laid down as an unqualiﬁed proposition of law\\nthat whenever injuries are on the body of the accused person, the presumption must\\nnecessarily be raised that the accused person had caused injuries in exercise of the\\nright of private defence. The defence has to further establish that the injury so caused\\non the accused probabilise the version of the right of private defence.313. Non-\\nexplanation of injuries on the person of the accused is a factor of great importance and\\nthis fact may induce the Court in judging the veracity of prosecution witnesses with\\nconsiderable care.314. The right of private defence cannot justiﬁably be raised by\\nshowing that one of the accused had suffered some minor injuries and the prosecution\\nhad not explained the same.315. In a given case it may strengthen the plea of private\\ndefence set up by the accused or may create genuine doubt regarding the prosecution\\ncase. At the same time it cannot be laid down as an invariable proposition of law that\\nas soon as it is found that the accused had received injuries in the same transaction in\\nwhich the complainant party was assaulted, the plea of private defence would stand\\nprima facie established and burden would shift on to the prosecution to prove that\\nthose injuries were caused to the accused in self-defence by the complainant party.316.\\nWhen the accused turned back from the house of the deceased whom they had visited,\\nthe deceased followed them along with his brother and mother and tried to attack them\\nfrom behind. The accused turned back and shot at him causing death. It was held that\\nthe conduct of the accused was justiﬁable. His acquittal was not interfered with.317.\\nWhere the deceased along with his father was putting up a fence which was protested\\nby the accused resulting in an altercation, and the accused suddenly dealt a lathi blow\\non the head of the deceased which proved fatal, it was held that since the accused\\nreceived injuries as a result of assault by the deceased and his father, the accused had\\njustiﬁably exercised his right of private defence.318. In a case of murder some of the\\nserious injuries found on the person of the accused were not explained and some of\\nthe prosecution witnesses also were injured, it was held that it could be said that the\\naccused party had acted in exercise of right of private defence and conﬁrmation of the\\nacquittal of all the accused but one by the High Court was not proper.319. Where\\nserious injuries inﬂicted on the person of the accused could not be explained by the\\nprosecution, the accused could be said to be entitled to the right of private defence.\\nTheir conviction under section 300 was held to be not proper.320.\\nIn State of UP v Mukunde,321. the Supreme Court observed that merely on the ground\\nthat the prosecution witnesses have not explained the injuries on the accused, their\\nevidence ought not to be rejected if the Court ﬁnds it probable that the accused might\\nhave acted in exercise of the right of private defence. The Supreme Court also\\nobserved in a subsequent case322. that:\\nit cannot be held as a matter of law or invariably a rule that whenever an accused sustained\\nan injury in the same occurrence the prosecution is obliged to explain the injury and on the\\nfailure of the prosecution to do so, the prosecution case should be disbelieved. Before non-\\nexplanation of injuries on the person of the accused by the prosecution witnesses may\\naffect the prosecution case, the court has to be satisﬁed of the existence of two conditions:\\n(1) that the injuries on the person of the accused were of a serious nature and (ii) such\\ninjuries must have been received at the time of the occurrence in question. Non-explanation\\nof injuries assumes greater signiﬁcance when the evidence consists of interested or\\npartisan witnesses or where the defence gives a version which completes in probability with\\nthat of the prosecution.323.\\nThese rulings were followed in Kashi Ram v State of MP324. The accused persons were\\nalleged to have assaulted the prosecution party, but the prosecution witnesses failed to\\nexplain serious injuries including injuries on the vital parts of the body sustained by one\\nof the accused in the same incident. The Court said that this could not be a ground for\\ndiscarding the prosecution story and for acquittal of all accused persons.\\nWhere the accused had some trivial injuries on non-vital parts but the victim had\\nsuffered as many as 19 injuries including some on vital parts which resulted in his\\ndeath, it could not be believed that the accused had acted in self-defence especially\\nwhen he was arrested ﬁve or six days after the incident but in the intervening time did\\nnot care to get himself medically examined. A plea of private defence cannot be based\\non surmises and speculation.325.\\nThe Supreme Court has also observed that merely because there was a quarrel and the\\naccused persons also sustained injuries, it did not confer a right of private defence to\\nthe extent of causing death. Though such right cannot be weighed in golden scales, it\\nhas at least to be shown that the accused persons were under such grave\\napprehension about the safety of their life and property and that the retaliation to the\\nextent actually done was absolutely necessary.326.\\nThe number of injuries is not always a safe criterion for determining as to who was the\\naggressor. It cannot be stated as a universal rule that whenever injuries are on the body\\nof the accused person, a presumption must necessarily be raised that the accused\\npersons had caused injuries in the exercise of the right of private defence. The defence\\nhas further to show that injuries on the accused probabilise the version of the right of\\nprivate defence.327. In moments of excitement and disturbed mental equilibrium,\\nparties cannot be expected to preserve composure and use exactly only so much in\\nretaliation as is commensurate with the apprehended danger. Due weightage has to be\\ngiven to what happened at the spur of the moment at the spot. Things have to be\\njudged pragmatically keeping in view, the normal human reactions and behaviour, self-\\npreservation being the paramount consideration. Microscopic and pedantic scrutiny\\nhas to be avoided.328.\"), ('96.7', 'Retaliation.—\\nThe Supreme Court observed:\\nFrom a plain reading of the sections (Ss. 96–106) it is manifest that such a right can be\\nexercised only to repel unlawful aggression and not to retaliate. To put it differently, the right\\nis one of defence and not of requital or reprisal. Such being the nature of the right, the High\\nCourt could not have exonerated the accused persons of the charges levelled against them\\nby bestowing on them the right to retaliate and attack the complainant party.329.'), ('96.8', 'Where private defence not pleaded.—\\nIf circumstances show that the right of private defence was legitimately exercised, it is\\nopen to the Court to consider such a plea, even if accused had not taken it. A right of\\nprivate defence need not speciﬁcally be taken and in the event the Court on the basis of\\nthe materials placed on record is in a position to come to such a conclusion, the Court\\nmay act thereupon.330. Where the right of private defence was not pleaded by the\\naccused, but it appeared that the complainant was the aggressor, the Bombay High\\nCourt held that the beneﬁt of such defence could still be given to the accused.331. Fact\\nthat accused pleaded alibi-itself will not preclude the Court from giving him also the\\nright of private defence if on proper appraisal of evidence and other material on\\nrecords, Court ﬁnds it to be available to him.332. The right of private defence cannot be\\ndenied merely because the accused adopted a different line of defence particularly\\nwhen the evidence adduced by the prosecution would indicate that they were put under\\na situation where they could reasonably have apprehended grievous hurt even to one of\\nthem.333. The Supreme Court endorsed this principle by saying that it is not necessary\\nthat the plea of private defence must always be taken by the accused person. Even if\\nthe accused does not do so, the Court can consider it if the circumstances show that\\nthe right of private defence was legitimately exercised.334.\\nThe accused has not to plead self-defence by examining some witnesses or by making\\nany statement. But there has to be some material available on record to indicate that\\nthe accused had attacked the deceased in exercise of the right of self-defence.335.'), ('96.9', 'In appeal.—\\nIt is permissible for accused to raise that plea at the stage of appeal as the settled\\nlegal position is that even if the accused does not plead self-defence, it is open to\\nconsider such a plea if the same arises from the material on record.336.\\n2004 Cr LJ 1778 : (2005) 9 SCC 71 [LNIND 2004 SC 1370] .\\n[LNIND 2010 SC 70] : AIR 2010 SC 1212 [LNIND 2010 SC 70] : 2010 Cr LJ 1393 : (2010) 2\\nSCC(Cr) 1037.\\n[LNIND 2006 SC 1108] : 2006 AIR SCW 6298.\\n: AIR 2010 SC 1212 [LNIND 2010 SC 70] : 2010 Cr LJ 1393 : (2010) 2 SCC(Cr) 1037.\\n[LNIND 2005 SC 224] .\\n1203] : (2005) 10 SCC 404 [LNIND 2004 SC 1203] .\\n(2012) 4 SCC 79 [LNIND 2012 SC 160] .\\n[LNIND 2005 SC 224] .\\n[LNIND 2006 SC 1108] : 2006 AIR SCW 6298.\\n494 : AIR 1991 SC 1316 [LNIND 1991 SC 177] : 1991 Cr LJ 1464 ; Satya Narain Yadav v Gajanand,\\n(2008) 16 SCC 609 [LNIND 2008 SC 2782] : (2008) 10 Scale 728 [LNIND 2008 SC 2782] .\\n1203] : (2005) 10 SCC 404 [LNIND 2004 SC 1203] .\\n1970 SC 338] .

Section 99 provides the limitations. These two sections combined\\ntogether lay down the principles of the right of private defence.\\nThe ﬁrst clause of this section provides for the defence of body against any offence\\naffecting the human body. The second provides for the defence of property against an\\nact which amounts to the commission of certain offences.\\nThere is no obligation upon a person entitled to exercise the right of private defence\\nand to defend his person or property, to retire merely because his assailant threatens\\nhim with violence.337.\\nExplaining the genesis of the rule, the Supreme Court has observed:338.\\n\"It is important to bear in mind that self-preservation of one\\'s life is the necessary\\nconcomitant of the right of life enshrined in Art. 21 of the Constitution of India, fundamental\\nin nature, sacred, precious and inviolable. The importance and validity of the duty and right\\nto self-preservation has a species in the right of self-defence in criminal law. Centuries ago\\nthinkers of this great land conceived of such right and recognised it.\"'), ('97.1', \"Aggressor has no right of private defence.—\\nThe right to defend does not include a right to launch an offensive or aggression.339.\\nThe right of private defence does not arise where the accused were the aggressors and\\nthe question of exceeding such right also does not arise.340. The Supreme Court\\nadded, in this case, that the right of self-defence arises when there is unexpected\\napprehension and one is taken unawares, or the accused happens to kill accidentally\\nwhile using reasonable force private defence can be used to ward off unlawful force, or\\nto prevent it, to avoid unlawful detention and to escape from such detention.341.\\nWhen the father of the accused was trying to forcibly remove the gate of the thrashing\\nground of the deceased which was situated on the land of the deceased, his act\\namounted to an offence of 'mischief'. And, if the deceased while protecting his own\\nproperty assaulted the father of the accused with a lathi, and the accused killed him in\\nreturn, the accused could not claim the right of private defence of body of his\\nfather.342. In another case of the same kind the father of the accused was trying to pull\\nout the gate of the deceased thrashing mill and on the deceased assaulting him in\\nprotection, the accused struck him dead. The right of private defence was not available\\nin the circumstances.343. Where the parties went away from the property over which\\nthey were ﬁghting, the death caused at that shifted place was not a justiﬁable exercise\\nof the right of private defence.344. Where the accused succeeded in establishing their\\nright to the property in dispute through the Court and then went to the ﬁeld with a view\\nto ask the other party to vacate the premises, it was held that it by itself did not render\\nthem to be aggressors for the purpose of denying them the beneﬁt of right of self-\\ndefence.345.\\nNumber of injuries is not always the safe criterion for determining who the aggressor\\nis. The fact of injuries on the body of the accused does not by itself create the\\npresumption that the accused was entitled to the right of private defence.346.\"), ('97.2', 'Unlawful assembly.—\\nSo long as an assembly of persons is acting in exercise of the right of private defence it\\ncannot be an unlawful assembly. An assembly though lawful to begin with, may in the\\ncourse of events become unlawful. So long as the accused persons were acting in\\nexercise of right of private defence, their object was not unlawful and so there was no\\nunlawful assembly but once they exceeded the right, the assembly ceased to be lawful\\nand became an unlawful assembly. There too only such of the members of the\\nassembly who shared the object of doing anything in excess of the exercise of right of\\nprivate defence, alone would be liable to be punished for the acts committed in\\nprosecution of the common object or for their individual unlawful acts.347.'), ('97.3', 'Right of private defence to be pleaded.—\\nIn a Supreme Court case it is stated,\\nIt is well settled that even if an accused does not plead self-defence, it is open to the Court\\nto consider such a plea if the same arises from materials on record.348.\\nBut if no plea was entered on behalf of the accused and there were also no\\ncircumstances to show that the accused had probably the right of private defence,\\nsuch a right could not be presumed on behalf of the accused on mere conjectures and\\nsurmises.349. A mere bald assertion without any evidence of facts and circumstances\\ndoes not make out a case of private defence.350. The accused can, however, make out\\nhis plea by mere preponderance of probabilities from materials already on record and\\nneed not prove it to the hilt.351. Where by preponderance of probabilities the plea of\\nprivate defence of the accused is plausible, beneﬁt should be extended to the\\naccused.352. Failure on the part of the prosecution to prove that the injuries on the\\nperson of the accused were not caused in self-defence, makes the defence of the\\naccused probable and he is entitled to its beneﬁt because he has not to prove his\\ndefence beyond reasonable doubt.353. Where the accused set up the plea of self-\\ndefence only during trial and not during investigation, it was held that this was not a\\nground for rejecting the plea.354. The accused on the observation of the High Court\\nthat the deceased was stabbed by the appellant, not in pursuance of any pre-planned\\nattack, but being under the impression that the deceased was coming to attack him.\\nThe said observation cannot be read out of context to make out a case that the\\naccused acted in self-defence. Such a plea is neither put forth in the statement under\\nsection 313 nor brought out in the cross examination of any of the prosecution\\nwitnesses.355. It is true that the right of private defence need not speciﬁcally be taken\\nand in the event the Court on the basis of the materials on record is in a position to\\ncome to such a conclusion, despite some other plea having been raised, that such a\\ncase had been made out, it may act thereupon.356.'), ('97.4', \"CASES.—Defence of person.—\\nUnder circumstances which might have induced the belief that a man was cutting the\\nthroat of his wife, their son shot and killed his father. It was held that if the son had\\nreasonable ground for believing and honestly believed that his act was necessary for\\nthe defence of his mother, the homicide was excusable.357. Where a girl was being\\nsexually molested and her father hit the assailant resulting in consequential death, it\\nwas held that the father was entitled to the right of private defence irrespective of the\\nfact whether the affair was with or without consent because of the girl being a\\nminor.358. Where a man found his wife in compromising position with a person who\\nsprang at the husband and caused him multiple injuries, some of them grievous, the\\nhusband thereafter gave a chopper blow resulting in the death of that person, it was\\nheld that the husband had not exceeded his right of private defence and was entitled to\\nacquittal.359. Where the father of the accused was being given lathi blows by the\\ncomplainant party, the accused ﬁred from the licensed gun of his father to defend his\\nfather, it was held that he had acted in the exercise of the right of private defence\\nwhether the injuries caused to his father were simple or grievous.360. Trespassers on\\nthe property of another cannot get any beneﬁt of right of private defence if they are\\nattacked by the person in possession of the property.361. However no one including the\\ntrue owner has a right to dispossess the trespasser by force if the trespasser is in\\nsettled possession of the land and in such a case unless he is evicted in due course of\\nlaw, he is entitled to defend his possession even against the rightful owner. Such\\npossession of the trespasser must extend over a suﬃciently long period and\\nacquiesced in by the true owner.362. Though law permits even a trespasser in settled\\npossession to defend his possession but, it does not permit a person to take the law in\\nhis own hand to take forcible possession merely because he has obtained a favourable\\norder under section 145 Cr PC, 1973. Such a person cannot claim private defence.363.\\nSettled possession means such clear and effective physical possession that under the\\ncriminal law he, even if he is a trespasser, gets the right to defend his possession of the\\nproperty against an attack even by the true owner.364. If no party is proved to be in\\nsettled possession, the question of exercise of right of private defence does not\\narise.365. Where the accused were in possession of the property and had grown the\\npaddy, they were entitled to defend their possession by using reasonable force which in\\nthe instant case went up to causing of death as the party in possession was attacked\\nand grievous blows were given to them.366. Where the prosecution party attacked the\\naccused, his brothers and others with sharp edged weapons and lathis and when they\\ntried to enter the latter's house, the accused ﬁred at the crowd resulting in the death of\\na man and injuries to others, it was held that the accused had acted only in the exercise\\nof the right of private defence and he was entitled to complete acquittal.367. Where the\\naccused was ﬁred at to dispel his party from attempting to rescue their friend from\\nillegal police detention and an informer accompanying the police who tried to prevent\\nthem from snatching the police gun received fatal injuries, it was held that they were\\nentitled to the right of private defence.368. Where a fatal injury was caused in\\nconsequence of hot exchange of words, the right of private defence was held to be not\\navailable.369. The Supreme Court has suggested that the number and nature of injuries\\nsustained by the accused and the deceased in any case, may furnish good evidence to\\nconsider whether the accused was acting in private defence and, if so, whether he had\\nexceeded his right. In the state of the evidence on record in that case and the number\\nof injuries suffered by the accused, the Court did not accede to the contention that the\\nright was not properly exercised.370.\"), ('97.5', \"Defence of another person.—\\nThe right of private defence need not necessarily be exercised for the defence of one's\\nown person; it can be exercised for the defence of the person of another one.371.\"), ('97.6', 'Defence of property.—\\nEvery person in possession of land is entitled to defend his possession against anyone\\nwho tries to eject him by force,372. or to steal from it;373. or to do an act which will have\\nthe effect of causing injury to it, e.g., cutting of a bund.374. Even if a trespass has been\\ncommitted, in certain situations, right of private defence can be used to eject the\\ntrespassers.375. Where the accused had no right, title, interest or possession of the\\nland in issue, right of private defence of property did not vest in him.376.\\nWhere the complainant party was about 300 feet away from the disputed land and it\\nwas further found that the accused had not shown that there was any injury on the\\nperson of the accused, it was held that no right of private defence arose in favour of the\\naccused. 377.'), ('97.7', \"Open space.—\\nThough private defence is available in respect of criminal trespass or mischief as\\nagainst the property owned by himself or of any other person, but criminal trespass is\\nnot enumerated as one of the offences under section 103 IPC, 1860. Therefore, the\\nright of private defence of property will not extend to the causing of death of the\\nperson who committed such acts, if the act of trespass is in respect of an open land.\\nOnly a house-trespass committed under such circumstances as may reasonably cause\\napprehension that death or grievous hurt would be the consequence is enumerated as\\none of the offences under section 103.378. But in another judgment Supreme Court\\nheld that there is no law that right of self-defence cannot be exercised in relation to a\\ndispute over an open space.379. Where the trespasser was in settled possession of the\\nﬁeld in question, and the party who claimed ownership started ploughing the ﬁeld, it\\nwas held that the trespasser (accused) had the right of private defence of his\\npossession over property and offer resistance, but that he exceeded that right in\\ncausing death. His act fell under exception 2 to section 300 and punishable under\\nsection 304, Part I.380. Where a goat of the accused entered the ﬁeld of another and he\\nwas trying to take it way, the other struck him with lathi blows and also his companion\\nwho came to his rescue. Only then the accused retaliated with lathi blows resulting in\\ndeath. Supreme Court upheld the acquittal.381. The right is subject to restrictions\\nimposed by section 99, the accused party was in possession of the land, the deceased\\nparty wanted to enter into possession forcibly. One of the aggressors was killed and\\nanother grievously hurt. The accused that caused the death was held to be guilty of\\nexceeding the right of private defence. The acquittal of the person who caused\\ngrievous hurt with a spear was held to be not proper. He was liable to be convicted\\nunder section 326.382. Accused having not been in settled possession had no right to\\nself-defence to defend the possession of the property.383. Occurrence took place on\\nthe land which was in possession of deceased. Accused cannot take the plea of private\\ndefence.384. No right of private defence of property to a person who was not in\\npossession of the property.385.\\nWhere the accused to a certain stage acted in defence of their property but exceeded it\\nin breaking into the room of their victim, striking him with a lathi blow and also his wife\\nand daughter who were also there in the room, the victim subsequently dying, their\\nconviction was shifted from under section 302 to that under section 304 Part 1.386.\\nThe right of private defence of property (share in land) was held to have been exceeded\\nwhen the deceased's side being armed with lathis only, the accused party ﬁred at them\\nwith a gun, killing one and injuring others. The right of private defence was not available\\nto them.387.\\nWhere the ﬁnding of the Courts below was that the accused and his companions were\\naggressors because they assaulted the victim and his children when they came out to\\nprotest against cutting of their by the accused, it was held that the beneﬁt of the right\\nof private defence was not available to the accused.388.\\nDefence of property may create circumstances ripening into the right of defence of\\nperson. This is so because even in defending property, the attack and counter-attack is\\nlikely to be on person. This was the situation in a case in which the accused while\\ndefending land over which they had possession; they became the victim of attack on\\nperson with sharp cutting weapons. It became their right to repel the danger of\\ngrievous hurt or even death and to use for that purpose reasonably appropriate force.\\nTheir right extended to cause death of the aggressors if that could be the only way of\\nsaving themselves.389.\"), ('97.8', \"CASES.—Exceeding private defence.—\\nThe father of the accused was attacked by the deceased with a lathi and suffered a\\nsimple injury on his head, whereupon the accused in order to protect his father\\nadministered a fatal blow on the chest of the deceased with a ballam. It was held that\\nthough the accused had the right of private defence, he had obviously exceeded it and\\nwas, therefore, liable under section 304-Part I, IPC, 1860.390. A somewhat contrary view\\nhas, however, been taken by the Supreme Court in a later case where too the accused\\nhad exercised his right of private defence against a lathi blow on the head. Thus, in Deo\\nNarain's case it has been held that the accused was justiﬁed in using his spear though\\nthe other party had aimed only a lathi blow on the head, which being a vulnerable part\\neven a lathi blow could prove dangerous.391. It thus, appears that the part of the body\\nagainst which the attack is directed is more important than the weapon used. Where\\nthe deceased attacked the accused with a stick and the accused retaliated by stabbing\\nthe former to death his offence fell under section 304-Part I, IPC, 1860, as he had\\nexceeded the right of private defence.392. Evidence on record showed that accused had\\nreceived many injuries on his person, and exercised right of private defence of person\\nin good faith. He had sustained four injuries on various parts of his body including on\\nvital parts, thus, case would be covered by Exception 2 to section 300 of IPC, 1860. The\\nnature of weapon used, circumstances in which incident took place, injuries on body of\\naccused as well as deceased, showed that there was no premeditation. He had\\nexercised his right of self-defence but having regard to the injuries inﬂicted by him on\\ndeceased, he exceeded same.393. Where the accused, a person with only one hand was\\nattacked with a bamboo and sustained several injuries and then to ward off further\\nattack gave only one blow with a pen-knife on the aggressor which unfortunately fell on\\na vital part resulting in his death, it could not be said that he had exceeded his right of\\nprivate defence. For the accused it was a case of life or death struggle and his case,\\ntherefore, squarely fell within the ambit of clauses (1) and (2) of section 100, IPC, 1860,\\nand he could not be held guilty of any offence.394. In a sudden group clash over a\\nhouse both sides received injuries and one person was killed. There was no prior\\nenmity between two groups and the whole incident developed suddenly. Accused\\npersons received quite a number of injuries, some on vital parts, and the prosecution\\nwas not able to explain those injuries. It was held that the accused could not be said to\\nhave exceeded the right of private defence. Their conviction was set aside.395. Two\\narmed bullies of a locality raided a ﬂat in a drunken state and demanded money from\\nthe inmates with the use of force. This amounted to the crime of extortion giving the\\ninmates the right to defend themselves against the raiders. Both the raiders met their\\ndeath in the process of the ensuing scuﬄe, it being not known nor capable of being\\nascertained who played what roll in the combat. The Supreme Court held that it could\\nnot be said of any one of them that he exceeded the right of private defence. Hence,\\nthey could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34.396. The accused\\nusing his licenced gun ﬁred only one shot after receiving a severe blow on his head\\nfracturing his skull. It was held that he did not exceed his right of self-defence.397. A\\nperson had a lurking suspicion about illicit relations between his elder brother's wife\\nand the accused and he caught hold of the accused when the latter visited their house\\nto meet her. The accused inﬂicted knife injuries on him to extricate himself but did not\\ninﬂict any further injury after freeing himself. It was held that the accused had not\\nexceeded the right of private defence and was not guilty under section 307 for\\nattempted murder.398. Where the accused ﬁred a single gunshot at the deceased party\\nto save his uncle who had received serious injuries in the attack made by the deceased\\nparty, the gun shot unfortunately proved fatal, the accused could not be said to have\\nexceeded his right of self- defence.399. Where in a murder case over obstruction of\\nwater course, the victim assaulted the accused twice and injured him whereupon the\\naccused inﬂicted a blow on him which proved fatal, the accused could not be said to\\nhave exceeded his right of private defence.400.\\nA police party was looking for the accused to affect their arrest. The complainant party\\nwas helping the police. On being located, the accused party opened ﬁre. The police\\nwithdrew after receiving injuries. Two members of the complainant party were killed.\\nEven a runaway complainant was shot down. This showed that the attack continued\\neven when all danger to the accused party had ceased. Thus, they exceeded the right of\\nprivate defence. Conviction for murder was upheld.401.\\nWhere the death occurred due to the ﬁring resorted to as part of the self-defence, the\\nsame would amount to 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder', which was\\ncommitted without any pre-meditation in a sudden ﬁght, in the heat of passion and\\nupon a sudden quarrel and that the offender could not be said to have taken undue\\nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner, which would normally fall under\\nException 4 of section 300 IPC, 1860.402.\"), ('97.9', \"Burden on accused to probablise his defence.—\\nIt is for the accused to establish the plea of private defence. He is not required to prove\\nit beyond reasonable doubt. The Court has only to examine probabilities in appreciating\\nthe plea. In the present case, the accused had miserably failed to establish or even to\\nprobablise his defence. The deceased persons had merely asked them why they had\\ncut the mature crop, when they became the victim of attack. They were unarmed.403.\\nThe accused need not take the plea of private defence explicitly.

It\\nplaces an important restriction on the exercise of the right of defence. The right of\\nprivate defence being granted for defence only, it must not and cannot legally be\\nexercised when there is time to have recourse to the protection of public authorities.\\nThe right of private defence does not take the place of the functions of those public\\nservants who are especially charged with the protection of life and property and the\\napprehension of offenders, and where the assistance of the public authorities can be\\nprocured, the right cannot be lawfully exercised. But the law does not intend that a\\nperson must run away to have recourse to the protection of public authorities when he\\nis attacked instead of defending himself.419. A person in possession cannot be\\nexpected to leave his property at the mercy of armed trespassers. Where there is\\nimminent danger to the property and the person in possession apprehends substantial\\ndamage thereto, he is entitled to raise his own arms in defence and retaliate to keep\\naway the attack without applying for State aid.420.

The important considerations which always\\narise in order to determine whether the action of the accused is covered by the right of\\nprivate defence are, ﬁrst, what is the nature of the apprehended danger, and, second,\\nwhether there was time to have recourse to the police authorities, always remembering\\nthat when both the parties are determined to ﬁght and go up to the land fully armed in\\nfull expectation of an armed conﬂict in order to have a trial of strength the right of\\nprivate defence disappears.422.'), ('99.7', \"CASES.—Time to obtain protection of public authorities.—\\nThe accused received information one evening that the complainants intended to go on\\nhis land on the following day, and uproot the corn sown in it. At about three o'clock next\\nmorning he was informed that the complainants had entered on his land and were\\nploughing up the corn. Thereupon he at once proceeded to the spot, followed by the\\nremaining accused, and remonstrated with the complainants, who commenced an\\nattack on the accused. In the ﬁght which ensued, both sides received serious injuries,\\nand the leader of the complainants' party was killed. It was held that the complainants\\nbeing the aggressors, the accused had the right of private defence and that they were\\nnot bound to act on the information received on the previous evening and seek the\\nprotection of the public authorities, as they had no reason to apprehend a night attack\\non their property.423. In a case involving an old land dispute, one party (accused)\\noffered resistance to prevent the other from ploughing the land and on refusal went up\\nto the place where the other was sitting without arms and inﬂicted stick blows causing\\ndeath, it was held that the accused was rightly convicted. The Court said that a rightful\\nowner can defend his possession against any attempt to dislodge him, but that once a\\ntrespasser has established his foothold; resort should be had to public authorities.424.\\nThe right of private defence does not extend to inﬂicting of more harm than necessary\\nfor the purpose of defence. The prosecution party, in this case, had gone to plough the\\nland which was in the possession of the accused (appellant). The latter had time to go\\nand report the matter to appropriate authorities constituted under the law. But instead\\nof so doing, they brutally attacked the other party resulting in the death of three\\npersons. Thus, there was no right of private defence. It was held that there was no\\nwarrant for converting the conviction from u/section 302 to section 304 Part II.425.\"), ('99.8', 'Fourth clause.—\\nThe right of private defence is restricted to not inﬂicting more harm than it is necessary\\nto inﬂict for the purpose of defence. The amount of force necessarily depends on the\\ncircumstances of the case, and there is no protection if the harm is caused by\\nexcessive violence quite unnecessary to the case.426. For example, a person set by his\\nmaster to watch a garden or yard is not at all justiﬁed in shooting at, or injuring in any\\nway, persons who may come into those premises, even in the night. He ought ﬁrst to\\nsee whether he could not take measures for their apprehension.427. The measure of\\nself-defence must always be proportionate to the quantum of force used by the\\nattacker and which it is necessary to repel.428. In dealing with the question as to\\nwhether more force is used than is necessary or than was justiﬁed by the prevailing\\ncircumstances, it would be inappropriate to adopt tests of detached objectivity of a\\nCourt room. The means which a threatened person adopts or the force which he uses\\nshould not be weighed in golden scales.429. Though a person exercising his right of\\nprivate defence is not expected to modulate his defence step by step or tier by tier, yet\\nit is necessary to see that it is not totally disproportionate to the injury sought to be\\naverted, e.g., to ward off a slap one cannot ﬁre a gun. Thus, where the father of the\\naccused was allegedly assaulted with lathis which resulted in simple injuries, the\\naccused was not justiﬁed in ﬁring his gun and thereby killing the attacker. In such a\\ncase it could not be said that there was a reasonable apprehension of death or\\ngrievous hurt within the meaning of clause (1) of section 100, IPC, 1860.430. But at the\\nsame time it should also be remembered that if a man has real justiﬁcation to exercise\\nhis right of private defence, he cannot be held liable if he slightly exceeds his right of\\nprivate defence, e.g., where face to face with a murderous attack he ﬁres two shots in\\nquick succession, for these things cannot be weighed in golden scales.431. The right of\\nprivate defence should not be allowed to be pleaded or availed of as pretext for a\\nvindictive, aggressive or retributive purpose.432.'), ('99.9', 'CASES.—Justiﬁable harm.—\\nA party attempted to rescue a friend from unlawful police detention.

In another case the Supreme Court accepted the defence version that\\nthere were four assailants who had come well prepared to assault at the door of their\\nhouse. In such a situation accused persons could have a reasonable apprehension of\\ndeath or at least of grievous hurt. It was a case of single gunshot which was not\\nrepeated. Therefore, it cannot be said that the accused persons had exceeded their\\nright of private defence in any manner.434.\\nIn view of the fact that the accused was pursued, that he only picked up the weapon\\nwhen he was chased and that he used it only once, his sentence was reduced to three\\nyears and nine months.435.'), ('99.10', 'Attack on unarmed persons.—\\nNo right of private defence can exist against an unarmed and unoffending\\nindividual;436. where the injury was caused to the victim on the vital parts of the body\\neven though he and the witnesses present at the spot were all unarmed, it was held\\nthat the question of acting in self-defence did not arise.437.'), ('99.11', 'Sudden quarrel.—\\nThe right of private defence was held to be not available where the incident of lathi\\nblows causing death took place in the course of a sudden ﬁght.438.'), ('99.12', 'More harm caused than necessary.—\\n2004 Cr LJ 1778 : (2005) 9 SCC 71 [LNIND 2004 SC 1370] .\\n592 .\\n(1925) 6 Lah 392; Achhru Ram, (1925) 7 Lah 104.\\nWhere a person killed a weak old woman found stealing at night,439. where a person\\ncaught a thief in his house at night and deliberately killed him with a pick-axe to prevent\\nhis escape;440. where a number of persons apprehending a thief committing house-\\nbreaking strangled him and subjected him to gross maltreatment when he was fully in\\ntheir power,441. and where a heavy and mechanically propelled vehicle like a jeep was\\nused as a means or weapon for the exercise of the right of private defence,442. the right\\nof private defence was negatived.443.

Where, on the other hand, two drunk and armed raiders demanded\\nmoney from the residents of a ﬂat and in face to face with the inmates who resisted\\nthem, lost their lives, it being not known which inmate played what role, the Supreme\\nCourt held that it could not be said that more harm was caused than was\\nnecessary.445. Where the accused caused death in order to repel an attack by a party\\narmed with lethal weapons and which had already caused injuries to the accused, it\\nwas held that the accused did not exceed his rights as it was not possible for him to\\nhave weighed in golden scales in the heat of the moment the number of injuries\\nrequired to overcome the attack.446.

It must be proportionate to and commensurate with\\nthe quality and character of the act it is intended to meet and what is done in excess is\\nnot protected. Where the accused was attacked by three persons and sustained an\\ninjury on the forehead, a vital part, he had reasonable apprehension of some hurt to be\\ncaused to him and had the right of self-defence but had exceeded by causing more\\nharm to his assailants than needed. He was liable under section 304, Part I, and not\\nunder section 302.450. Where after receiving nine injuries, two on vital parts, the\\naccused ﬁred one shot from his gun which hit fatally an innocent person, the right of\\nprivate defence extending to cause death was still available to the accused. His\\nconviction under section 304, Part I was set aside.451. Where the complainant's party\\nhad deliberately gathered near the house of the accused and scolded them and caused\\ninjuries to his father, the accused was held justiﬁed in exercising the right of private\\ndefence to defend his father and his conviction under section 300 was set aside.452. It\\nis the reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt that gives rise to the right of\\nprivate defence under clauses (1) and (2) of section 100, IPC, 1860., and it has got\\nnothing to do with the actual injury that the person exercising the right of private\\ndefence has suffered, which may or may not be grievous.453. Where the accused fails\\nto make out a case of reasonable apprehension, he cannot claim the right of private\\ndefence.454. Where the life of the accused was not endangered by the ladies armed\\nwith broom sticks and 'chappals', the accused was not entitled to stab one of the ladies\\nto death in exercise of right of private defence.455.\\nThe extended right of private defence to the extent of causing death of the assailant\\narises only if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right is of one of the\\nkinds mentioned in this section.456. Following some earlier rulings, the Supreme Court\\nhas re-emphasised that the mere fact of the accused sustaining some injuries in the\\ncourse of the same transaction does not make it out conclusively that the accused had\\nthe occasion to cause death in private defence.457. Where the attacking party chanced\\nto get at the wife of the accused and the latter pounced upon them with a weapon\\nattacking one of them which was warded off, another came forward and the accused\\nsuccessfully struck him and he died, the accused was held to be within his rights.458.\\nAs against this where two were ﬁghting with lathis and the brother of one of them, who\\nwas outside the danger, struck a lathi blow to the other killing him, he was held to be\\nguilty under section 304-I.459. In a communal tension, both sides pelted stones. The\\naccused ﬁred a gun shot causing death of a person of the other group though no one\\nhad sustained any injury as a result of pelting of stones by the other group. It was held\\nthat the accused had no occasion to act under the right of private defence.460.\\nIn order to justify the act of causing death of assailant, the accused has simply to\\nsatisfy the Court that there was reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt.\\nQuestion whether the apprehension was reasonable or not is a question of fact\\ndepending upon the facts and circumstances of each case and no straitjacket formula\\ncan be prescribed in this regard. Weapon used, the manner and nature of assault and\\nother surrounding circumstances should be taken into account while evaluating\\nwhether the apprehension was justiﬁed or not. In the instant case, accused G was\\nassaulted on head by a sharp-edged weapon which caused a bone-deep injury. As per\\nthe defence version there were four assailants who had come well prepared at the door\\nof accused's house to commit assault. Reasonable apprehension of death or at least of\\ngrievous hurt, therefore, could not be ruled out. In such a situation, if single gunshot\\nwas ﬁred it could not be said that the accused persons had exceeded their right of\\nprivate defence in any manner.461.\"), ('100.1', '\\'Abducting\\'.—\\nOn a plain reading of clause ﬁfth of this section, there does not seem to be any reason\\nfor holding that the word \\'abducting\\' used in the clause means anything more than\\nwhat is deﬁned as \"abduction\" in section 362. All that the clause requires is that there\\nshould be an assault which is an offence against the human body and that assault\\nshould be with the intention of abducting, and whenever these elements are present the\\nclause will be applicable.462. Thus, a woman could not be taken away by force even by\\nher own husband from a paramour\\'s house and if in these circumstances the paramour\\nand his brother killed the husband to prevent her abduction by the husband, they would\\nbe protected by sub-clause (5) of section 100 of the Penal Code.463. Here law seems to\\nbe contrary to our social conscience, but this interpretation is perfectly in accord with\\nthe language of section 100, IPC, 1860, and the decision of the Supreme Court in\\nViswanath\\'s case464. where too the husband was put to death by a clean stab by his\\nbrother-in-law as he was trying to take away his wife by force from his father-in-law\\'s\\nhouse and in the process had merely dragged his unwilling wife to some distance.'), ('100.2', 'Rescuing woman-folk from attack on modesty.—\\nThe accused heard the cries for help of his widowed sister-in-law.

There was no justiﬁcation for using the gun in such as to cause\\ndeath. Conviction under section 304 Part I was restored.469. The right of private\\ndefence was not allowed to be claimed merely on the ground that there was a quarrel\\nand the accused sustained injuries in the course of it.470.'), ('100.4', 'No danger.—\\nTwo friends were sitting together and consuming liquor.

The deceased came to his land and asked the accused party\\nto get the land measured and also tried to dislodge a pole ﬁxed by them. There was no\\nimminent danger to person on property from any act of the deceased. No injuries\\ncaused to anybody.

The right lasts so long as the reasonable apprehension of\\nthe danger to the body continues.484. It commences and continues as long as danger\\nto body lasts. The extent to which the exercise of the right will be justiﬁed will depend\\nnot on the actual danger but on whether there was reasonable apprehension of such\\ndanger. There must be an attempt or threat and consequent thereon an apprehension\\nof danger; but it is not a mere idle threat, or every apprehension of a rash or timid mind,\\nthat will justify the exercise of the right. Reasonable ground for the apprehension is\\nrequisite. Suppose the threat to proceed from a woman or child and to be addressed to\\na strong man, in such a case there could hardly be a reasonable apprehension. Present\\nand imminent danger seems to be meant.485. The person exercising a right of private\\ndefence must consider whether the threat to his person or his property is real and\\nimmediate. If he reaches the conclusion reasonably that the threat is immediate and\\nreal, he is entitled to exercise his right. In the exercise of his right, he must use force\\nnecessary for the purpose and he must stop using the force as soon as the threat has\\ndisappeared. So long as the threat lasts and the right of private defence can be\\nlegitimately exercised; if the danger is continuing, the right is there; if the danger or the\\napprehension about it has ceased to exist there is no longer the right of private\\ndefence.486.

In Corpus Juris Secundum, vol I at p\\n306, the meaning of the word 'abet' is given as follows:\\n'To abet' has been deﬁned as meaning to aid; to assist or to give aid; to command, to\\nprocure, or to counsel; to countenance; to encourage, counsel, induce, or assist; to\\nencourage or to set another on to commit.\\nUsed with 'aid'. The word 'abet' is generally used with the word 'aid' and similar words.\\nIn order to bring a person abetting the doing of a thing, under any one of the clauses\\nenumerated under section 107, it is not only necessary to prove that the person who\\nhas abetted has taken part in the steps of the transactions but also in some way or\\nother he has been connected with those steps of the transactions which are criminal.\\nThe offence of abetment depends upon the intention of the person who abets, and not\\nupon the act which is actually done by the person whom he abets.1.\\nFor the purposes of the ﬁrst two clauses of this section it is immaterial whether the\\nperson instigated commits the offence or not or the persons conspiring together\\nactually carry out the object of the conspiracy.2. It is only in the case of a person\\nabetting an offence by intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the\\ncharge of abetment against him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to\\nhave committed the offence is acquitted of that offence.3. The Court noted that in\\nFaguna Kanta Nath v State of Assam4. the appellant was tried for an offence under\\nsection 165A for having abetted the commission of an offence by an oﬃcer, who was\\nacquitted, and it was held that the appellant's conviction for abetment was also not\\nmaintainable. But subsequently in Jamuna Singh v State of Bihar,5. it was considered\\nnot desirable to hold that an abettor cannot be punished if the person actually\\ncommitting the offence is acquitted. The Court said that the abettor's guilt depends\\nupon the nature of the offence abetted and the manner of abetment. It is only in cases\\nof intentional aiding that the abettor would have to be acquitted with the principal\\noffender.6. Following this state of the rulings the Supreme Court ordered the acquittal\\nof the single abettor when the main offender as also all other abettors already stood\\nacquitted.\\nThe Supreme Court has reiterated that before anybody can be punished for abetment\\nof suicide, it must be proved that the death in question was a suicidal death.7.\\nThe Supreme Court held that the offence of abetment is a separate and independent\\noffence. Where the offence is committed in consequence of the abetment but there is\\nno provision for punishment of such abetment, the abettor is to be punished along with\\nthe offender for the original offence.8.\\nAbetment is constituted by:\\n(1) instigating a person to commit an offence; or\\n(2) engaging in a conspiracy to commit it; or\\n(3) intentionally aiding a person to commit it.\\nThe offence of abetment by instigation depends upon the intention of the person who\\nabets and not upon the act which is done by the person who has abetted. The\\nabetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid as provided under section\\n107, Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860. However, the words uttered in a ﬁt of anger or\\nomission without any intention cannot be termed as instigation.9.\"), ('107.1', 'Mens rea.—\\nIn order to proceed against a person for criminal offence under section 107,\\nprosecution must prove the element of mens rea. Negligence or carelessness or the\\nfacilitation cannot be termed to be abetment so as to punish the guilty as per the\\nprovision of penal laws.10. In order to constitute abetment, the abettor must be shown\\nto have \"intentionally\" aided to commission of the crime. Mere proof, that the crime\\ncharged could not have been committed without involvement and/or interposition of\\nthe alleged abettor is not enough compliance with the requirements of section 107. It is\\nnot enough that an act on the part of the alleged abettor happens to facilitate the\\ncommission of the crime. Intentional aiding and therefore active complicity is the gist\\nof the offence of abetment under the third paragraph of section 107.11.'), ('107.2', \"Sting operation, mens rea and abetment.—\\nIn typical sting operations, though the operation is carried in the public interest, the\\nsame is generally done by instigating the accused. Hence the victim, who is otherwise\\ninnocent, is lured into committing a crime on the assurance of absolute secrecy and\\nconﬁdentiality of the transaction raising the potential question as to how such a victim\\ncan be held responsible for the crime which he would not have committed but for the\\nenticement. In such circumstances, should the individual, i.e., the sting operator be held\\ncriminally liable for commission of the offence that is inherent and inseparable from\\nthe process by which commission of another offence is sought to be established?\\nWhat about the operator who has mens rea or guilty intention to commit the offence?\\nThese are puzzling questions when there is an allegation that the sting operator is\\nalleged to have committed the abetment of the offence. The Supreme Court in Rajat\\nPrasad v CBI,12. observed that a crime does not stand obliterated or extinguished\\nmerely because its commission is claimed to be in public interest. At the same time,\\nthe criminal intent (mens rea) behind the commission of the act will have to be\\nestablished before the liability of the person charged with the commission of crime can\\nbe adjudged. The Court held that the questions whether the sting operation is a\\njournalistic exercise and any criminal intent can be imputed are to be answered by the\\nevidence of the parties.\\n(1) Abetment by instigation.—First clause.—A person is said to 'instigate' another to an\\nact, when he actively suggests or stimulates him to the act by any means of language,\\ndirect or indirect, whether it takes the form of express solicitation, or of hints,\\ninsinuation or encouragement.13.\"), ('107.3', '\"Instigate\" Meaning.—\\nInstigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do \"an act\". To\\nsatisfy the requirement of \"instigation\", though it is not necessary that actual words\\nmust be used to that effect or what constitutes \"instigation\" must necessarily and\\nspeciﬁcally be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the\\nconsequence must be capable of being spelt out. Where the accused had, by his acts\\nor omission or by a continued course of conduct, created such circumstances that the\\ndeceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide, in which case,\\n\"instigation\" may have to be inferred. A word uttered in a ﬁt of anger or emotion without\\nintending the consequences to actually follow, cannot be said to be instigation. Thus, to\\nconstitute \\'instigation\\', a person who instigates another has to provoke, incite, urge or\\nencourage the doing of an act by the other by \"goading\" or \\'urging forward\\'. The\\ndictionary meaning of the word \"goad\" is \"a thing that stimulates someone into action;\\nprovoke to action or reaction … to keep irritating or annoying somebody until he\\nreacts\".14. The word \"instigate\" literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring about\\nby persuasion to do anything. The abetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or\\nintentional aid as provided in the three clauses of the section.15. Instigate means the\\nactive role played by a person with a view to stimulate another person to do the thing.\\nIn order to hold a person guilty of abetting it must be established that he had\\nintentionally done something which amounted to instigating another to do a thing.16.\\nInstigation may be of an unknown person.17. A mere acquiescence or permission does\\nnot amount to instigation.18.'), ('107.4', 'Wilful misrepresentation or wilful concealment.—\\nExplanation 1 to this section says that a person who (1) by wilful misrepresentation, or\\n(2) by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily\\ncauses or procures, or attempts to cause or procure a thing to be done, is said to\\ninstigate the doing of that thing. The illustration is an example of instigation by \\'wilful\\nmisrepresentation\\'. Instigation by \\'wilful concealment\\' is where some duty exists which\\nobliges a person to disclose a fact. The explanation to section 107 says that any wilful\\nmisrepresentation or wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to\\ndisclose, may also come within the contours of \"abetment\".19.'), ('107.5', 'CASES.—Direct instigation.—\\nWhere, of several persons constituting an unlawful assembly, some only were armed\\nwith sticks, and A, one of them, was not so armed, but picked up a stick and used it, B\\n(the master of A), who gave a general order to beat, was held guilty of abetting the\\nassault made by them.20.'), ('107.6', 'Suicide.—\\nAbetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a\\nperson in doing a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or\\naid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.21. Deceased committed\\nsuicide by hanging himself because of alleged illicit relationship between his wife and\\nthe accused. Accused took the wife of deceased away from the house of her brother\\nand kept her with him for four days. There is deﬁnitely a proximity and nexus between\\nthe conduct and behaviour of the accused and wife of deceased with that of suicide\\ncommitted by the deceased.22. Where a married girl committed suicide by burning\\nherself in her in-law\\'s house, her in-laws were held guilty of abetment because they\\nwere persistently torturing her for inadequate dowry and had gone to the extent of\\naccusing her of illegitimate pregnancy.23. \"All these tortures and taunts\", Ray J said,24.\\n\"Caused depression in her mind and drove her to take the extreme step of putting an\\nend to her life by sprinkling kerosene oil on her person and setting it aﬁre.\" In another\\ncase of the same kind a husband persistently demanded more money from his wife,\\nquarrelling with her everyday. On the fateful day when she happened to say that death\\nwould have been better than this, she heard only this in reply that her husband would\\nfeel relieved if she ended her life. Immediately thereafter she set herself on ﬁre. The\\nhusband was held guilty of instigating her to commit suicide.25. Mere harassment of\\nwife by husband due to differences per se does not attract section 306 read with\\nsection 107, IPC, 1860.26.\\nDemand of loan amount by accused from deceased itself does not come within the\\nscope of abetment as deﬁned under section 107.27. Goading and intimidating a debtor\\nwith a view to pressurising him for repayment of the loan which brought about a\\nsuicide by the debtor immediately thereafter, was held as not amounting to abetment\\nof suicide and, therefore, no case under section 306 read with section 34 was made\\nout.28.\\nThe accused told the other person \"to go and die\". It was held that this would not in\\nitself satisfy the ingredients of instigation. Instigation has to be with mens rea. The\\nsuicide was committed two days after the quarrel between the accused and the\\ndeceased. This also showed that the suicide was not the direct result of the quarrel.\\nThe suicide note indicated that her husband was a frustrated man and given to drinking\\nand suffered from great stress and depression.29.\\nThe accused, a Motor Vehicle Inspector, beat up and abused a driver for not being able\\nto produce necessary papers. The driver committed suicide. The Court said that it was\\nnot shown that he was guilty of any act of abetment within the meaning of section 107.\\nThe charge against him under section 107 was quashed.30.'), ('107.7', 'Proof.—\\nIn Chitresh Kumar Chopra v State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi),31. the Supreme Court\\nreiterated the legal position laid down in its earlier three judge bench judgment in the\\ncase of Ramesh Kumar v State of Chhattisgarh,32. and held that where the accused by\\nhis acts or continued course of conduct creates such circumstances that the deceased\\nwas left with no other option except to commit suicide, an instigation may be inferred.\\nIn order to prove that the accused abetted commission of suicide by a person, it has to\\nbe established that:\\n(i) the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words, deeds or wilful\\nomission or conduct which may even be a wilful silence until the deceased\\nreacted or pushed or forced the deceased by his deeds, words or wilful omission\\nor conduct to make the deceased move forward more quickly in a forward\\ndirection; and\\n(ii) that the accused had the intention to provoke urge or encourage the deceased\\nto commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above. Undoubtedly,\\npresence of mens rea is the necessary concomitant of instigation.33.'), ('107.8', 'Threats.—\\nMere threats of involving the family in a false and frivolous case cannot be held to\\ntantamount to instigation. By such threats it cannot be held that the accused instigated\\nthe deceased to commit suicide.34.'), ('107.9', \"Test.—\\nNo straight-jacket formula can be laid down to ﬁnd out as to whether in a particular\\ncase there has been instigation which force the person to commit suicide. In a\\nparticular case, there may not be direct evidence in regard to instigation which may\\nhave direct nexus to suicide. Therefore, in such a case, an inference has to be drawn\\nfrom the circumstances and it is to be determined whether circumstances had been\\nsuch which in fact had created the situation that a person felt totally frustrated and\\ncommitted suicide.35.\\n(2) Abetment by conspiracy.—Second clause.—'Conspiracy' consists in the agreement\\nof two or more [persons] to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means.\\nSo long as such a design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to\\ncarry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the parties,\\npromise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being enforced, if lawful, is\\npunishable if for a criminal object or for the use of criminal means.36. It is not\\nnecessary that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it.\\nIt is suﬃcient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is\\ncommitted.37. Where parties concert together, and have a common object, the act of\\none of the parties, done in furtherance of the common object and in pursuance of the\\nconcerted plan, is the act of all.38.\\nBefore the introduction of Chapter V-A, conspiracy, except in cases provided for by\\nsections 121A, 311, 400, 401 and 402 of the Code, was a mere species of abetment\\nwhen an act or an illegal omission took place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and\\namounted to a distinct offence for each distinct offence abetted by conspiracy.39. For\\nan offence under the second clause of this section a mere combination of persons or\\nagreement is not enough; an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of\\nthe conspiracy. But for an offence under section 120A a mere agreement is enough if\\nthe agreement is to commit an offence.40.\"), ('107.10', 'Abetment and Conspiracy-Difference between.—\\nCriminal conspiracy postulates an agreement between two or more persons to do, or\\ncause to be done, an illegal act or an act which is not illegal, by illegal, means. It differs\\nfrom other offences because mere agreement is made an offence even if no step is\\ntaken to carry out that agreement. Though there is close association of conspiracy with\\nincitement and abetment the substantive offence of criminal conspiracy is somewhat\\nwider in amplitude than abetment by conspiracy as contemplated under section 107,\\nIPC, 1860.41. There is no analogy between section 120B and section 109, IPC, 1860.\\nThere may be an element of abetment in a conspiracy, but conspiracy is something\\nmore than an abetment. Offences created by sections 109 and 120B, iPC, 1860 are\\nquite distinct and there is no warrant for limiting the prosecution to only one element of\\nconspiracy, that is, abetment when the allegation is that what a person did was\\nsomething over and above that.42.\\n(3) Abetment by aid.—Third clause.—By act.—A person, it is trite, abets by aiding, when\\nby any act done either prior to, or at the time of the commission of an act, he intends to\\nfacilitate and does in fact facilitate the commission thereof, would attract the third\\nclause of section 107 of the IPC, 1860. Doing something for the offender is not\\nabetment. Doing something with knowledge so as to facilitate him to commit the crime\\nor otherwise would constitute abetment.43. In order to constitute abetment by aiding\\nwithin the meaning of the third paragraph of section 107, IPC, 1860 the abettor must be\\nshown to have intentionally aided the commission of the crime. A person may invite\\nanother casually or for a friendly purpose and that may facilitate the murder of the\\ninvitee. But unless it is shown that the invitation was extended with a view to facilitate\\nthe commission of the murder, it cannot be said that the person extending the\\ninvitation had abetted the murder. The language used in the section is \"intentionally\\naids\" and therefore, active complicity is the gist of the offence of abetment under the\\nthird paragraph of section 107, IPC, 1860.44. Abetment includes instigating any person\\nto do a thing or engaging with one or more persons in any conspiracy for the doing of a\\nthing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy and in\\norder to the doing of that thing, or intentional aid by any act or illegal omission to the\\ndoing of that thing. On facts held, in the instant case, there was no direct evidence to\\nestablish that the appellant either aided or instigated the deceased to commit suicide\\nor entered into any conspiracy to aid her in committing suicide.45. Where the principal\\noffender killed the victim with a knife provided by the defendant who later claimed that\\nhe thought the knife would be used only to threaten, the defendant\\'s conviction for\\nmurder was upheld, the Court of Appeal saying that the trial judge was correct to direct\\nthe jury that the defendant could be so convicted if he contemplated that the principal\\noffender might kill or cause serious bodily harm to the victim as part of their joint\\nenterprise.46. It is not necessary that the abettor should be present at the place of the\\noccurrence. It is also not necessary to show that the secondary party to a conspiracy to\\nmurder intended the victim to be killed provided it is proved that he contemplated or\\nforesaw the event as a real or substantial risk. Mere absence from the scene of the\\ncrime cannot amount to unequivocal communication of withdrawal from the\\nenterprise. The accused was recruited with certain others by a person to kill his wife. At\\na predetermined time she was taken to the agreed place and killed. The accused was\\nnot present when the killing took place. It was held that he was rightly convicted in that\\nhe had lent encouragement and assistance before the commission of the crime.47.'), ('107.11', 'By illegal omission.—\\nThe deﬁnition of abetment as given in section 107, IPC, 1860 not only includes\\ninstigation but also intentional aiding by an illegal omission.48. A lady advocate was\\nattending the chamber of her senior advocate, the accused. On the day of the incident\\nshe was talking with the accused at her residence. At that moment in his presence, she\\npoured kerosene on her and set herself on ﬁre. The accused did nothing to save her. It\\nwas held that this did not amount to \"illegal omission\".

B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to\\ncommit murder.\\n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers\\nfrom the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder.\\nExplanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law\\nof committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or\\nknowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.\\nILLUSTRATIONS\\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would\\nbe an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an\\noffence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be\\ncommitted or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.\\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of\\nage, to do an act which causes Z\\'s death. B, in consequence of the abetment,\\ndoes the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z\\'s death. Here though B\\nwas not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in\\nthe same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and\\nhad committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.\\n(c) A instigates B to set ﬁre to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the\\nunsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or\\nthat he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets ﬁre to the house in\\nconsequence of A\\'s instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of\\nabetting the offence of setting ﬁre to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the\\npunishment provided for that offence.\\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property\\nbelonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession. A induces B to believe that the property\\nbelongs to A. B takes the property out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith, believing\\nit to be A\\'s property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take\\ndishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting\\ntheft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.\\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such\\nan abetment is also an offence.\\nILLUSTRATION\\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C\\ncommits that offence in consequence of B\\'s instigation. B is liable to be punished for\\nhis offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the\\noffence, A is also liable to the same punishment.\\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by\\nconspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits\\nit. It is suﬃcient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is\\ncommitted.\\nILLUSTRATION\\nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison.\\nB then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison,\\nbut without mentioning A\\'s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and\\ndelivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers\\nthe poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together,\\nyet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered.\\nC has therefore committed the offence deﬁned in this section and is liable to the\\npunishment for murder.\\nCOMMENTS.—\\nAbetment under the IPC, 1860 involves active complicity on the part of the abettor at a\\npoint of time prior to the actual commission of the offence,59. and it is of the essence\\nof the crime of abetment that the abettor should substantially assist the principal\\nculprit towards the commission of the offence. Nowhere, concurrence in the criminal\\nacts of another without such participation therein as helps to give effect to the criminal\\nact or purpose, is punishable under the Code.\\n\\'Abettor\\', under this section, means the person who abets (1) the commission of an\\noffence, or (2) the commission of an act, which would be an offence if committed by a\\nperson not suffering from any physical or mental incapacity. In the light of the\\npreceding section he must be an instigator or a conspirator or an intentional helper.\\nMerely because the accused\\'s brother was carrying on criminal activities in her house,\\nthe appellant cannot be held guilty unless there is some material to show her\\ncomplicity.60.\\nExplanation 1.—If a public servant is guilty of an illegal omission of duty made\\npunishable by the Code, and a private person instigates him, then he abets the offence\\nof which such public servant is guilty, though the abettor, being a private person, could\\nnot himself have been guilty of that offence.\\nExplanation 2.—The question regarding abettor\\'s guilt depends on the nature of the act\\nabetted and the manner in which abetment was made. Commission of the act abetted\\nis not necessary for the offence of abetment.61. The offence of abetment is complete\\nnotwithstanding that the person abetted refuses to do the thing, or fails involuntarily in\\ndoing it, or does it and the expected result does not follow. The offence of abetment by\\ninstigation depends upon the intention of the person who abets, and not upon the act\\nwhich is actually done by the person whom he abets.\\nExplanation 3.—This explanation makes it clear that the person abetted need not have\\nany guilty intention in committing the act abetted. It applies to abetment generally and\\nthere is nothing to indicate that it applies only to abetment by instigation and not to\\nother kinds of abetment.62. The offence of abetment depends upon the intention of the\\nperson who abets and not upon the knowledge or intention of the person he employs to\\nact for him.\\nExplanation 4.—This Explanation is to be read as follows: \"When the abetment of an\\noffence is an offence the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence\". In view of\\nExplanation 4 appended under section 108 of the IPC, 1860 the contention of accused\\nthat there cannot be any abetment of an abetment and it is unknown to criminal\\njurisprudence, holds no water and merits no consideration.63.'), ('108.1', 'Abetment of attempt to commit suicide.—\\nSection 306 prescribes punishment for abetment of suicide while section 309 punishes\\nattempt to commit suicide.

The question of the abettor's guilt depends on the nature of the act\\nabetted and the manner in which the abetment was made. Under section 107, IPC,\\n1860 a person abets the doing of an act in either of three ways which can be:\\ninstigating any person to do an act; or engaging with one or more person in any\\nconspiracy for the doing of that act; or intentionally aiding the doing of that act. If a\\nperson instigates another or engages with another in a conspiracy for the doing of an\\nact which is an offence, he abets such an offence and would be guilty of abetment\\nunder section 115 or section 116, IPC, 1860 even if the offence abetted is not\\ncommitted in consequence of the abetment. The offence of abetment is complete\\nwhen the alleged abettor has instigated another or engaged with another in a\\nconspiracy to commit the offence. It is not necessary for the offence of abetment that\\nthe act abetted must be committed. This is clear from Explanation 2 and illustration (a)\\nthereto, to section 108, IPC, 1860. It is only in the case of a person abetting an offence\\nby intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the charge of abetment\\nagainst him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to have committed the\\noffence is acquitted of that offence.69.\")]\n",

B accepts the bribe. A has abetted the\\noffence deﬁned in section 161.\\n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation,\\ncommits that offence.

Section 109, IPC, 1860 becomes applicable even if\\nthe abettor is not present when the offence abetted is committed provided that he has\\ninstigated the commission of the offence or has engaged with one or more other\\npersons in a conspiracy to commit an offence and pursuant to that conspiracy some\\nact or illegal omission takes place or has intentionally aided the commission of an\\noffence by an act or illegal omission.76.\"), ('109.1', 'Scope.—\\nThis section lays down nothing more than that if the IPC, 1860 has not separately\\nprovided for the punishment of abetment as such then it is punishable with the\\npunishment provided for the original offence. Law does not require instigation to be in\\na particular form or that it should only be in words. The instigation may be by conduct.\\nWhether there was instigation or not, is a question to be decided on the facts of each\\ncase. It is not necessary in law for the prosecution to prove that the actual operative\\ncause in the mind of the person abetting was instigation and nothing else, so long as\\nthere was instigation and the offence has been committed or the offence would have\\nbeen committed if the person committing the act had the same knowledge and\\nintention as the abettor. The instigation must be with reference to the thing that was\\ndone and not to the thing that was likely to have been done by the person who is\\ninstigated. It is only if this condition is fulﬁlled that a person can be guilty of abetment\\nby instigation. Further, the act abetted should be committed in consequence of the\\nabetment or in pursuance of the conspiracy as provided in the Explanation to section\\nabetment if it is done in consequence of (a) instigation (b) conspiracy or (c) with the\\naid constituting abetment. Instigation may be in any form and the extent of the\\ninﬂuence which the instigation produced in the mind of the accused would vary and\\ndepend upon facts of each case. The offence of conspiracy created under section\\n120A is bare agreement to commit an offence. It has been made punishable under\\nsection 120B. The offence of abetment created under the second clause of section 107\\nrequires that there must be something more than mere conspiracy. There must be\\nsome act or illegal omission in pursuance of that conspiracy. That would be evident by\\nsection 107 (second), \"engages in any conspiracy … for the doing of that thing, if an act\\nor omission took place in pursuance of that conspiracy\". The punishment for these two\\ncategories of crimes is also quite different. Section 109, IPC, 1860 is concerned only\\nwith the punishment of abetment for which no express provision has been made in the\\nIPC, 1860. The charge under section 109 should, therefore, be along with charge for\\nmurder which is the offence committed in consequence of abetment. An offence of\\ncriminal conspiracy is, on the other hand, an independent offence. It is made\\npunishable under section 120B for which a charge under section 109 is unnecessary\\nand inappropriate.77. Section 109 provides that if the act abetted is committed in\\nconsequence of abetment and there is no provision for the punishment of such\\nabetment then the offender is to be punished with the punishment provided for the\\noriginal offence. \"Act abetted\" in section 109 means the speciﬁc offence abetted.\\nTherefore, the offence for the abetment of which a person is charged with the\\nabetment is normally linked with the proved offence.78. The commission of the offence\\nof rape in a hut then in possession of the accused was held to be not suﬃcient in itself\\nto show that the accused abetted the offence.79.'), ('109.2', 'Distinct offence.—\\nSection 109 is by itself creative of an offence though it is punishable in the context of\\nother offences. The accused was charged under sections 300 and 149. The Court said\\nthat he could not be convicted under section 300 with the aid of section 109. That\\nwould cause great prejudice to the accused in his defence.80. The offence for the\\nabetment of which a person is charged with the abetment is normally linked with the\\nproved offence.81. A plain reading of sections 107–109 of the IPC, 1860 would show\\nthat act complained of in order to amount to abetment has to be committed either prior\\nto or at the time of commission of the offences.82.\\nWhere the appellant, the wife of a co-accused asked the prosecutrix, aged 15 years to\\ngo to the house of the accused and to bring lassi, and when the prosecutrix reached\\nthere, the co-accused, who were two in number, bolted the house from inside and\\ncommitted rape on her, it was held that the appellant was guilty of the offence of\\nabetment. 83.'), ('109.3', \"Failure to prevent is not abetment.—\\nIt has been held by the Supreme Court that a failure to prevent the commission of an\\noffence is not an abetment of that offence. The Court said:\\nWhere a person aids and abets the perpetrator of a crime at the very time when the crime is\\ncommitted, he is a principal of the second degree and section 109 applies. But mere failure\\nto prevent the commission of an offence is not by itself an abetment of that offence.\\nConsidering the deﬁnition in section 109 strictly, the instigation must have reference to the\\nthing that was done and not to the thing that was likely to have been done by the person\\nwho is instigated. It is only if this condition is fulﬁlled that a person can be guilty of\\nabetment by instigation. Section 109 is attracted even if the abettor is not present when the\\noffence abetted is committed provided that he had instigated the commission of the\\noffence or had engaged with one or more other persons in a conspiracy to commit an\\noffence and pursuant to the conspiracy some act or illegal omission takes place or\\nintentionally induced the commission of an offence by an act or illegal omission. In the\\nabsence of direct involvement, conviction for abetment is not sustainable. Section 109\\nprovides that if the act abetted is committed in consequence of abetment and there is no\\nprovision for the punishment of such abetment then the offender is to be punished with the\\npunishment provided for the original offence. Section 109 applies even where the abettor is\\nnot present. Active abetment at the time of committing the offence is covered by section\\nThe words 'act abetted' as used in section 109 means the speciﬁc offence abetted. Mere\\nhelp in the preparation for the commission of an offence which is not ultimately committed\\nis not abetment within the meaning of section 109. 'Any offence' in section 109 means\\noffence punishable under IPC or any special or local law. The abetment of an offence under\\nthe special or local law, therefore, is punishable under section 109. For constituting offence\\nof abetment, intentional and active participation by the abettor is necessary.84.\\nWhen a person is charged with the abetment of an offence, it is normally linked with an\\noffence which has been proved.85.\"), ('109.4', 'Procedure.—Failure to frame Charge.—\\nSection 109, IPC, 1860 is a distinct offence.

The object of the gathering must be to\\nattain by force and violence an object of a general public nature thereby striking directly\\nagainst the Government\\'s authority.10.\\nIn Md Jamiluddin Nasir v State of WB,11. while enumerating what principles are to be\\nkept in mind in cases, involving application of sections 121, 122, 121A read with\\nsection 120B IPC, 1860 as well as section 302 IPC, 1860, the Supreme Court, observed\\ninter alia that not all violent behaviour would fall within the prescription of waging war\\nas contemplated under sections 121, 121A, 122 read with section 120B. It was also\\nfound that the object sought to be achieved to make a case for the application of\\nsection 121, should be directed against the sovereignty of the State and not merely\\ncommission of a crime, even if that happens to be of higher magnitude. The concept of\\n\\'waging war\\' should not be stretched too far. A balanced and realistic approach should\\nbe maintained while construing the offence committed, to ﬁnd out whether it amounts\\nto waging of war against the State.\\nthe manner usual in war. In other words, in order to support a conviction on such a\\ncharge it is not enough to show that the persons charged have contrived to obtain\\npossession of an armoury and have, when called upon to surrender it, used the riﬂes\\nand ammunition so obtained against the Government troops. It must also be shown\\nthat the seizure of the armoury was part and parcel of a planned operation and that\\ntheir intention in resisting the troops of the Government was to overwhelm and defeat\\nthese troops and then to go on and crush any further opposition with which they might\\nmeet until either the leaders of the movement succeeded in obtaining the possession\\nof the machinery of Government or those in possession of it yielded to the demands of\\ntheir leaders.12. An illuminating discussion on the issue of \"Waging war against the\\nGovernment of India\" is to be found in this Court\\'s decision in State (NCT of Delhi) v\\nNavjot Sandhu @ Afsan Guru.13. In para 272 of the judgment P Venkatarama Reddi, J,\\nspeaking for the Court, referred to the report of the Indian Law Commission that\\nexamined the draft Penal Code in 1847 and quoted the following passage from the\\nreport:\\nWe conceive the term \\'wages war against the Government\\' naturally to import a person\\narraying himself in deﬁance of the Government in like manner and by like means as a\\nforeign enemy would do, and it seems to us, we presume it did to the authors of the Code\\nthat any deﬁnition of the term so unambiguous would be superﬂuous.\\nThe expression, \"in like manner and by like means as a foreign enemy\", is very\\nsigniﬁcant to understand the nature of the violent acts that would amount to waging\\nwar. In \"waging war\", the intent of the foreign enemy is not only to disturb public peace\\nor law and order or to kill many people. A foreign enemy strikes at the sovereignty of\\nthe State, and his conspiracy and actions are motivated by that animus.14.'), ('121.2', 'New concept of \"Waging war\" and Caution against using old\\nauthorities.—\\nThe concept of war in section 121 which includes insurrection or a civilian uprising\\nshould not be understood in the sense of conventional war between two nations or\\nsovereign entities. The normative phenomenon of war as understood in the\\ninternational sense does not ﬁt into the ambit and reach of section 121. In the\\nParliament attack case,15. the Supreme Court held as follows:\\nwhile these are the acceptable criteria of waging war, we must dissociate ourselves from\\nthe old English and Indian authorities to the extent that they lay down a too general test of\\nattainment of an object of general public nature or a political object. The Supreme Court\\nexpressed reservations in adopting this test in its literal sense and construing it in a manner\\nout of tune with the present day. The court must be cautious in adopting an approach which\\nhas the effect of bringing within the fold of S.121 all acts of lawless and violent acts\\nresulting in destruction of public properties, etc., and all acts of violent resistance to the\\narmed personnel to achieve certain political objectives. The moment it is found that the\\nobject sought to be attained is of a general public nature or has a political hue, the offensive\\nviolent acts targeted against the armed forces and public oﬃcials should not be branded as\\nacts of waging war. The expression \"waging war\" should not be stretched too far to hold\\nthat all the acts of disrupting public order and peace irrespective of their magnitude and\\nrepercussions could be reckoned as acts of waging war against the Government. A\\nbalanced and realistic approach is called for in construing the expression \"waging war\"\\nirrespective of how it was viewed in the long past. An organised movement attended with\\nviolence and attacks against the public oﬃcials and armed forces while agitating for the\\nrepeal of an unpopular law or for preventing burdensome taxes were viewed as acts of\\ntreason in the form of levying war. We doubt whether such construction is in tune with the\\nmodern day perspectives and standards.'), ('121.3', 'Terrorist Acts.—\\nThough every terrorist act does not amount to waging war, certain terrorist acts can\\nalso constitute the offence of waging war and there is no dichotomy between the two.\\nTerrorist acts can manifest themselves into acts of war. According to the learned\\nSenior Counsel for the State, terrorist acts prompted by an intention to strike at the\\nsovereign authority of the State/Government, tantamount to waging war irrespective of\\nthe number involved or the force employed. However, the degree of animus or intent\\nand the magnitude of the acts done or attempted to be done would assume some\\nrelevance in order to consider whether the terrorist acts give rise to a state of war. Yet,\\nthe demarcating line is by no means clear, much less transparent. It is often a\\ndifference in degree. The distinction gets thinner if a comparison is made of terrorist\\nacts with the acts aimed at overawing the Government by means of criminal force.\\nConspiracy to commit the latter offence is covered by section 121A.16. The\\nincorporation of Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, shall not\\nbe viewed as deemed repeal of section 121 of the IPC, 1860. As explained in Navjot\\nSandhu (supra), a \"terrorist act\" and an act of \"waging war against the Government of\\nIndia\" may have some overlapping features, but a terrorist act may not always be an act\\nof waging war against the Government of India, and vice-versa. The provisions of\\nChapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and those of Chapter VI of the\\nIndian Penal Code (IPC), 1860 including section 121, basically cover different areas.17.'), ('121.4', 'Foreign nationals not excluded.—\\nThe word \"whoever\" is a word of broad import. Advisedly such language was used\\ndeparting from the observations made in the context of the Treason Statute. Supreme\\nCourt ﬁnds no good reason why foreign nationals stealthily entering into Indian territory\\nwith a view to subverting the functioning of the Government and destabilising the\\nsociety should not be held guilty of waging war within the meaning of section 121. The\\nsection on its plain term need not be conﬁned only to those who owe allegiance to the\\nestablished Government.18.\\nThe explanation to the section makes it clear that the offence is complete even without\\nany act or illegal omission occurring in pursuance of the conspiracy.19. It is not\\nnecessary that any act or illegal omission should have taken place in pursuance of a\\nconspiracy. An action of waging war, attempt to wage war or abetment to wage war are\\nalso covered by section 121-A.20.\\nnarrow and restricted sense in section 121. In our considered view, the expression\\n\"Government of India\" is used in section 121 to imply the Indian State, the juristic\\nembodiment of the sovereignty of the country that derives its legitimacy from the\\ncollective will and consent of its people. The use of the phrase \"Government of India\" to\\nsignify the notion of sovereignty is consistent with the principles of Public International\\nLaw, wherein sovereignty of a territorial unit is deemed to vest in the people of the\\nterritory and exercised by a representative government.21.\\nessential that as a result of the abetment the war should in fact be waged. The main\\npurpose of the instigation should be \\'the waging of war\\'. It should not be merely a\\nremote and incidental purpose but the thing principally aimed at by the instigation.\\nThere must be active suggestion or stimulation to the use of violence.22. As criminal\\nacts took place pursuant to the conspiracy, the appellant, as a party to the conspiracy,\\nshall be deemed to have abetted the offence. In fact, he took an active part in a series\\nof steps taken to pursue the objective of conspiracy. The offence of abetting the\\nwaging of war, having regard to the extraordinary facts and circumstances of this case,\\njustiﬁes the imposition of capital punishment and, therefore, the judgment of the High\\nCourt in regard to the conviction and sentence of Afzal under section 121 IPC, 1860\\nshall stand.23.'), ('121.5', \"Principles relating to Section 121.—\\n(i) No speciﬁc number of persons is necessary to constitute an offence under\\nS.121, Penal Code.\\n(ii) The number concerned and the manner in which they are equipped or armed is\\nnot material.\\n(iii) The true criterion is quo animo did the gathering assemble?\\n(iv) The object of the gathering must be to attain by force and violence an object of\\na general public nature, thereby striking directly against the King's authority.\\n(v) There is no distinction between principal and accessory and all who take part in\\nthe unlawful act incur the same guilt.24.\"), ('121.6', 'CASES.—Mumbai Terror Attack Case.—\\nThe primary and the ﬁrst offence that the appellant and his co-conspirators committed\\nwas the offence of waging war against the Government of India. What matters is that\\nthe attack was aimed at India and Indians. It was by foreign nationals. People were\\nkilled for no other reason than they were Indians; in case of foreigners, they were killed\\nbecause their killing on Indian soil would embarrass India. The conspiracy, in\\nfurtherance of which the attack was made, was, inter alia, to hit at India; to hit at its\\nﬁnancial centre; to try to give rise to communal tensions and create internal strife and\\ninsurgency; to demand that India should withdraw from Kashmir; and to dictate its\\nrelations with other countries. Nothing could have been more \"in like manner and by\\nlike means as a foreign enemy would do\".

Court is concerned with an 'unlawful assembly'.\\nWherever ﬁve or more persons commit a crime with a common object and intent, then\\neach of them would be liable for commission of such offence, in terms of sections 141\\nand 149, Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860). It is not possible to deﬁne the\\nconstituents or dimensions of an offence under section 149 simpliciter with regard to\\ndictionary meaning of the words 'unlawful assembly' or 'assembly'.2. An assembly of\\nﬁve or more persons having as its common object any of the ﬁve objects enumerated\\nunder section 1 41 of IPC is deemed to be an unlawful assembly. Membership of an\\nunlawful assembly is itself an offence punishable under section.143, whereas other\\nspecies of the said offence are dealt with under section 143–145 of IPC. Similarly,\\nsections 146–148 of IPC deals with the offence of rioting which is deﬁned to be use of\\nforce or violence by any member thereof. Section 149 makes every member of an\\nunlawful assembly liable for offence that may be committed by any member of the\\nunlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly or for\\ncommission of any offence that the members of the assembly knew to be likely to be\\ncommitted in prosecution of the common object of the assembly.3. To bring a case\\nwithin section 149 of IPC some essential features must be present. First, there must be\\nan existence of an unlawful assembly within the meaning of section 141 of IPC. This is\\na mixed question of fact and law.4.\\nThe underlying principle of section 141 is that law discourages tumultuous assemblage\\nof men to preserve the public peace. Section 141 deﬁnes what an 'unlawful assembly'\\nis. Section 142 gives the connotations of 'a member of an unlawful assembly'. Section\\n143 punishes tumultuous assemblies as they endanger public peace. It does not\\nrequire that the purpose of the unlawful assembly should have been fulﬁlled.\\nThe essence of an offence under this section is the combination of ﬁve or more\\npersons, united in the purpose of committing a criminal offence, and the consensus of\\npurpose is itself an offence distinct from the criminal offence which these persons\\nagree and intend to commit.5. Unlike the Indian law contained in section 141, IPC, 1860,\\nan unlawful assembly at common law need to have only three or more persons who\\nmust assemble together for the common purpose of committing an offence involving\\nuse of violence, or for achieving a lawful or unlawful object in such a manner so as to\\nlead to a reasonable apprehension of a breach of peace as a direct result of their\\nconduct.6. Thus, under section 141, IPC, especially under sub-section (3) thereof, use of\\nviolence or likelihood of breach of the peace is not at all a sine qua non for an offence\\nof unlawful assembly but this is so under the common law. So under the common law,\\neven if the purpose of the assembly is unlawful, the offence of being an unlawful\\nassembly would not be committed if there is no likelihood of breach of the peace and\\nthis would be so even if the unlawful common purpose is carried out.\"), ('143.1', \"Ingredients.—\\nAn 'unlawful assembly' is an assembly of ﬁve or more persons if their common object\\nis—\\n(a) the Central Government, or\\n(b) the State Government, or\\n(c) the Legislature, or\\n(d) any public servant in the exercise of lawful power;\\n(a) to take or obtain possession of any property, or\\n(b) to deprive any person of any incorporeal right, or\\n(c) to enforce any right or supposed right;\\n(a) to do what he is not legally bound to do, or\\n(b) to omit what he is legally entitled to do.\\nwhere ﬁve or more persons constituted an assembly that an unlawful assembly is born,\\nprovided, of course, the other requirements of the said section as to the common\\nobject of the persons composing that assembly are satisﬁed. In other words, it is an\\nessential condition of an unlawful assembly that its membership must be ﬁve or more.\\nThe Supreme Court has endorsed the view that the number of injuries caused and the\\nnumber of persons who were inﬂicted with those injuries, (in this case, three persons\\nwere attacked and they sustained 13, 12 and 7 injuries respectively) can give a clue to\\nthe fact that more than three persons must necessarily have participated in the\\nattack.8.\"), ('143.2', 'Effect of acquittal of some accused:\\nIn Mohan Singh v State of Punjab,9. the Supreme Court considered the question of\\nacquittal of two of the accused charged for the offence under section 302 read with\\nsection 149, on the conviction of the remaining three accused. If ﬁve or more persons\\nare named in the charge as forming an unlawful assembly and the evidence adduced\\nby the prosecution proves that charge against all of them that is a very clear case\\nwhere section 149 could be invoked. \"It is however not necessary that ﬁve or more\\npersons must be convicted before a charge under section 149 could be successfully\\nbrought home to any members of the unlawful assembly. It may be that less than ﬁve\\npersons may be charged and convicted under section 302 read with section 149, if the\\ncharge is that persons before the court along with others named, constituted an\\nunlawful assembly. Other persons so named may not be available for trial along with\\ntheir companions for the reason that they have absconded. In such a case, the fact that\\nless than ﬁve persons are before the court does not make section 149 inapplicable.\\nTherefore, in order to bring home a charge under section 149, it is not necessary that\\nﬁve or more persons must necessarily be brought before the court and convicted …\" In\\nview of the decision of the Constitution Bench in Mohan Singh\\'s case,10. even after\\nacquittal of the two accused from all the charges levelled against them, if there is any\\nmaterial that they were members of the unlawful assembly, the conviction under\\nsection 302 can be based with the aid of section 149.11.\\nWhere two of the six accused persons were acquitted without any ﬁnding that some\\nother known or unknown persons also were involved in the assault, the remaining four\\naccused persons could not be said to be members of an unlawful assembly.12. Where\\na group of persons, differently armed, assaulted a man with the common object of\\nkilling him and all the assailants accused except one were acquitted, it was held that\\nthe remaining sole accused could not be convicted and sentenced under section 302\\nwith the aid of section 149. The court cannot carve out a new case.13. If out of an\\nunlawful assembly consisting of seven named persons four are acquitted, the other\\nthree cannot be convicted of rioting as members of an unlawful assembly.14. They may,\\nhowever, be convicted of the principal offence with the aid of section 34, IPC, 1860.15.\\nWhere presence of eight persons in the course of assault was established, four of them\\nwere given beneﬁt of doubt but there was no ﬁnding anywhere to the effect that only\\nfour persons had taken part in the assault, conviction of the remaining four on the\\ncharge of forming unlawful assembly was not illegal.16.\\nwhether such object can be classiﬁed as one of those described in section 141;\\nsecondly, such common object need not be the product of prior concert but may form\\non spur of the moment, ﬁnally, nature of such common object is a question of fact to\\nbe determined by considering the nature of arms, nature of assembly, behaviour of\\nmembers, etc.17. Mere presence in an assembly does not make a person a member of\\nan unlawful assembly unless it is shown that he had done something or omitted to do\\nsomething which would make him a member of the unlawful assembly or unless the\\ncase falls under section 142.18. Thus, merely because some persons assembled, all of\\nthem cannot be condemned \\'ipso facto\\' as being members of that unlawful\\nassembly.19. At the same time it cannot be laid down as a general proposition of law\\nthat unless an overt act is proved against a person, who is alleged to be a member of\\nunlawful assembly, it cannot be said that he is a member of an assembly. The only\\nthing required is that he should have understood that the assembly was unlawful and\\nwas likely to commit any of the acts which fall within the purview of section 141.20.\\nFurther the prosecution has to prove that the commission of the offence was by any\\nmember of an unlawful assembly and such offence must have been committed in\\nprosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or such that the members\\nof the assembly knew that it was likely to be committed.21. The word \\'object\\' means the\\npurpose or design and, in order to make it \\'common\\', it must be shared by all. In other\\nwords, the object should be common to the persons, who compose the assembly, that\\nis to say, they should all be aware of it and concur in it. A common object may be\\nformed by express agreement after mutual consultation, but that is by no means\\nnecessary. It may be formed at any stage by all or a few members of the assembly and\\nthe other members may just join and adopt it. Once formed, it need not continue to be\\nthe same. It may be modiﬁed or altered or abandoned at any stage.22.\\nSection 142 postulates that whoever, being aware of facts which render any assembly\\nan unlawful one, intentionally joins the same would be a member thereof. Whether an\\nassembly is unlawful one or not, would depend on various factors, the principal\\namongst them being a common object formed by the members thereof to commit an\\noffence speciﬁed in one or the other clauses contained in section 141.23. In a free ﬁght\\nbetween two groups resulting in death of one person and injuries to several others on\\nboth the sides, it was held that the formation of an unlawful assembly was not\\nimpossible but the common object of such an assembly cannot be determined on the\\nbasis of serious injury by one of them.24. The accused along with about six–eight\\nothers forcibly entered into the oﬃce of a union leader and assaulted him but the victim\\ndid not receive any serious injury inside the union oﬃce and managed to escape. Later\\non in the open space some members of the crowd surrounded and attacked him and\\ndealt fatal blows. It was held that the accused who entered the union oﬃce did not\\nshare the common object of committing murder of the deceased. They were convicted\\nunder sections 326/149.25. Where the accused forming an unlawful assembly\\nassaulted the deceased but the injury caused by only one accused proved to be fatal\\nand the injuries caused by the others were found to be simple, it was held that the\\ncommon object of the unlawful assembly was only to cause grievous hurt and only the\\naccused who caused fatal injury was liable to be convicted for murder and others\\nunder section 326/149.26.\\nThe Supreme Court observed on the facts of a case that given the circumstances in\\nwhich the assembly came together and given that all parties were aware that among\\nthem, certain members carried weapons like guns and spear, even if it was held that\\ncommon object of assembly was not to cause death, it would not be an unreasonable\\ninference that all accused knew that the offence of culpable homicide was likely to be\\ncommitted in prosecution of such an armed assault on another group which was not\\nprepared to withstand such an attack, bringing about application of second portion of\\nsection 149. Therefore, it was held, that any of the accused found to have participated\\nin the assault should be held guilty under section 141 and 149.27.'), ('143.3', 'Determination of Common object:\\nDetermination of the common object of an unlawful assembly or the determination of\\nthe question whether a member of the unlawful assembly knew that the offence that\\nwas committed was likely to be committed is essentially a question of fact that has to\\nbe made keeping in view the nature of the assembly, the arms carried by the members\\nand the behaviour of the members at or near the scene and a host of similar or\\nconnected facts and circumstances that cannot be entrapped by any attempt at an\\nexhaustive enumeration.28. It is diﬃcult indeed, though not impossible, to collect direct\\nevidence of such knowledge. An inference may be drawn from circumstances such as\\nthe background of the incident, the motive, the nature of the assembly, the nature of the\\narms carried by the members of the assembly, their common object and the behaviour\\nof the members soon before, at or after the actual commission of the crime.29.'), ('143.4', 'Second clause—Resisting Law or Legal Process.—\\nResistance to some law, or legal process, connotes some overt act, and mere words,\\nwhen there is no intention of carrying them into effect, are not suﬃcient to prove an\\nintention to resist.30. When an order is lawfully made under the provisions of a statute,\\nthat order is law, and resistance to the execution of that law is an offence.31.\\nUnder this clause the act resisted must be a legal act. Where a number of persons\\nresisted an attempt to search a house which was being made by oﬃcers, who had not\\nthe written order investing them with the power to do so, it was held that the persons\\nresisting the attempted search were not guilty of this offence.32. Assembling together\\nfor the common object of rescuing a friend from unlawful police detention has been\\nheld by the Supreme Court as not constituting an unlawful assembly.33.'), ('143.5', 'Third clause.—Committing Criminal Trespass, Mischief, other\\noffence.—\\nThis clause speciﬁes only two offences, viz., mischief and criminal trespass, but the\\nwords \\'or other offence\\' seem to denote that all offences are included though only two\\nare enumerated in a haphazard way. In Manga @ Man Singh v State of Uttarakhand, the\\nSupreme Court while considering the application of principle of \\'ejusdem generis\\' to\\nsection 141 \\'third\\' clause, observed that:\\nWe fail to appreciate as to how simply because the offences mischief or criminal trespass\\nare used preceding the expression \"other offence\" in Section 141 \\'third\\', it should be taken\\nthat such offence would only relate to a minor offence of mischief or trespass and that the\\nexpression \"other offence\" should be restricted only to that extent. As pointed out by us\\nabove, the offence of mischief and trespass could also be as grave as that of an offence of\\nmurder, for which the punishment of life imprisonment can be imposed as provided for\\nunder Sections 438, 449, 450 etc. Therefore, we straight away hold that the argument of\\nlearned senior counsel for the Appellants to import the principle of \\'ejusdem generis\\' to\\nSection 141 \\'third\\', cannot be accepted.34.'), ('143.6', 'Suleman Bakery Case:\\nIt is a case related to the communal riots of Mumbai in early 1993. Government\\nimposed curfew and the Special Operation Squad (SOS) was called to control the\\ncommunal riots on information of stone pelting, throwing of glass bottles, acid bulbs\\nand ﬁring from the terrace of Suleman Bakery. It was argued that at any rate SOS was\\nan unlawful assembly on account of the third clause of section 141 of IPC, 1860, and\\nhence, all the discharged accused persons were members of the unlawful assembly\\nand had to be at least charged and inquired into by the courts below. It was argued that\\nthe assembly of the police at least till the time they broke open the door was a lawful\\nmove, as it was their duty but they should not have broken open the door and\\ntrespassed the Suleman bakery; and all those who entered Suleman bakery formulated\\nan unlawful assembly as they illegally trespassed into the Suleman bakery. Since A-1,\\nShri Tyagi, had ordered them to break open the doors and he was a part of that unlawful\\nassembly who had the common object. The Supreme Court held that they were all the\\nmembers of the SOS and had the duty to quell the riots. They were not doing anything\\nillegal in coming out and trying to control the riots. Court rejected the argument by\\nholding that a trespass becomes a criminal trespass if it is with an intention to annoy\\nor to do something illegal which is not the case here. There was no question of the so-\\ncalled entry amounting to criminal trespass.35.'), ('143.7', 'Fourth clause—Application of Criminal Force.—\\nThe act falling within the purview of this clause is made punishable owing to the\\ninjurious consequences which it is likely to cause to the public peace. This clause does\\nnot take away the right of private defence of property. It does not affect clause 2 of\\nsection 105, which allows a person to recover the property carried away by theft. It is\\nmeant to prevent the resort to force in vindication of supposed rights. It makes a\\ndistinction between an admitted claim or an ascertained right and a disputed claim.36.\\nWhere ﬁve or more persons assemble for maintaining by force or show of force a right\\nwhich they bona ﬁde believe they possess, and not for enforcing by such force or show\\nof force a right or supposed right of theirs, they do not constitute an unlawful\\nassembly.37. An assembly of ﬁve or more persons cannot be designated as an unlawful\\nassembly under this section if its object is to defend property by the use of force within\\nthe limits prescribed by law.38. But when a body of men are determined to vindicate\\ntheir rights, or supposed rights, by unlawful force, and when they engage in a ﬁght with\\nmen who, on the other hand, are equally determined to vindicate, by unlawful force,\\ntheir rights or supposed rights, no question of self-defence arises.

Thus, where a large procession of Kannadigas, taken out to voice protest\\nagainst Maharashtrians, turned violent, started pelting stones and attacking police\\noﬃcers; the procession turned into an unlawful assembly the moment it developed the\\ncommon object of causing damage to property and injuries to police oﬃcers.\\nThereafter, every person who continued as a member of the assembly became liable\\nfor the offence committed by the processionalists by virtue of section 149 of IPC,\\nmanner, the other members in the procession cannot be held guilty of the offence by\\nfoisting vicarious liability, merely because they were in the procession.49.'), ('143.11', \"CASES.—Enforcement of right by use of criminal force.—Dispute\\nregarding possession of land.—\\nWhere there was a dispute of long standing between the accused and certain other\\nparties regarding possession of certain land, and the accused went to sow the land\\nwith indigo, accompanied by a body of men armed with sticks who kept off the\\nopposite party by brandishing their weapons while the land was sowed, it was held that\\nthey were guilty of this offence.50.

It is only the use of force that\\ndistinguishes rioting from an unlawful assembly.54. Under the Common law when\\nmembers of an unlawful assembly actually carry out their unlawful common purpose\\nwith violence, so as to cause alarm, they are guilty of riot. For a successful prosecution\\nof a riot case the prosecution must prove:—\\n(i) that there were ﬁve or more persons;\\n(ii) that they had a common purpose;\\n(iii) that they had begun to execute such purpose;\\n(iv) that they intended to help one another by force, if necessary;\\n(v) that they had shown such degree of violence which would alarm at least one\\nperson of reasonable courage.\\nThis last mentioned fact need not be proved by calling a person, who has been so\\nalarmed but it may be made out from facts and circumstances of the case in hand.55.\\nThe ingredients mentioned in item numbers (iv) and (v) above are not to be found at all\\nin section 146 of IPC, 1860. Where some youths exceeding three were found\\ndemolishing a wall but disappeared the moment the caretaker of the building appeared\\nat the scene, it was held that they could not be convicted of the offence of riot under\\nthe common law as there was no evidence of show of violence suﬃcient to alarm one\\nperson of reasonable ﬁrmness and courage.56. In the Indian context in this very case\\nthe offence of rioting was complete the moment the youths used force to demolish the\\nwall for it was not necessary in the Indian law to use force or violence against a person,\\nfar less to cause alarm to a person of reasonable courage and ﬁrmness. Force or\\nviolence against an inanimate object too comes within the purview of section 146, IPC,'), ('147.1', \"Ingredients.—\\nThe following are the essentials of the offence of rioting:—\\n(1) That the accused persons, being ﬁve or more in number, formed an unlawful\\nassembly.\\n(2) That they were animated by a common object.\\n(3) That force or violence was used by the unlawful assembly or any member of it in\\nprosecution of the common object.\\nrestricted to force used against persons only, but extends also to force against\\ninanimate objects.58. The words 'force' and 'violence' in this section connote different\\nand distinct concepts. 'Force' is narrowed down by the deﬁnition under section 350 to\\npersons while the word 'violence' includes violence to property and other inanimate\\nobjects.59.\\nThe use of any force, even though it be of the slightest possible character, by any one\\nof an assembly once established as unlawful, constitutes rioting.60. Where a member\\nof an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of the assembly throws\\ndown a man and then causes him bodily hurt, the offence of rioting under this section\\nis complete as soon as the man is thrown down by using force and the hurt\\nsubsequently caused would come under section 323 or section 325.61. The essential\\nquestion in a case under section 147 is whether there was an unlawful assembly of ﬁve\\nor more persons. The identity of the persons comprising the assembly is a matter\\nrelating to the determination of the guilt of the individual accused and even when it is\\npossible to convict less than ﬁve persons only, section 147 still applies, if upon the\\nevidence in the case the Court is able to hold that the person or persons who have been\\nfound guilty were members of an assembly of ﬁve or more persons, known or unknown,\\nidentiﬁed or unidentiﬁed.62. It has been held by the Supreme Court that this section is\\nnot attracted where the act in question was done in pursuit of a lawful object. In this\\ncase the investigating police party was being led by the witness to a spot for recovering\\nthe dead-body. The witness tried to run away and was beaten up with a lathi. He died\\nshortly thereafter. The Supreme Court did not sustain the conviction of the police\\npersonnel under this section.63.\\nassembly outside the common object of the assembly or of such a nature as the\\nmembers of the assembly could not have known to be likely to be committed in\\nprosecution of that object are only chargeable against the actual perpetrators of those\\nacts.64. It is obligatory on the part of the court to examine that if the offence\\ncommitted is not in direct prosecution of the common object, it yet may fall under\\nsecond part of section 149, IPC, 1860, if the offence was such as the members knew\\nwas likely to be committed. Further inference has to be drawn as what was the number\\nof persons; how many of them were merely passive witnesses; what were their arms\\nand weapons. Number and nature of injuries is also relevant to be considered.65.\"), ('147.2', \"'Resistance to illegal warrant'.—\\nResistance to the execution of an illegal warrant within reasonable bounds does not\\namount to rioting; but when the right of resistance is exceeded and a severe injury, not\\ncalled for, is inﬂicted, the person who inﬂicts the injury may be convicted of such\\ninjury.66.\"), ('147.3', \"'Sudden quarrel'.—\\nIf a number of persons assembled for any lawful purpose suddenly quarrel without any\\nprevious intention or design, they do not commit 'riot' in the legal sense of the word.67.\"), ('147.4', '\\'Fundamental principles in cases of mammoth rioting\\'.—\\n(1) Notwithstanding the large number of rioters or of the persons put up in Court for\\nrioting, and the consequent diﬃculty for the prosecution to name the speciﬁc acts\\nattributed to each of the accused, the Court must see to it that all the ingredients\\nrequired for unlawful assembly and rioting are strictly proved by the prosecution before\\nconvicting the particular accused persons.68.(2) Spectators, wayfarers, etc., attracted\\nto the scene of the rioting by curiosity, should not be, by reason of their mere presence\\nat the scene of rioting and with the rioters, held to be members of the unlawful\\nassembly or rioters. But of course, if they are proved to have marched with the rioters\\nfor a long distance, when the rioters were shouting tell-tale slogans and pelting stones,\\nit will be for them to prove their innocence under section 106 of the Indian Evidence\\nAct, 1872. (3) It will be very unsafe, in the case of such a large mob of rioters, to rely on\\nthe evidence of a single witness speaking to the presence of an accused in that mob for\\nconvicting him, especially when no overt act of violence, or shouting of slogan, or\\norganising the mob, or giving orders to it or marching in procession with it, or other\\nsimilar thing is proved against him. In a big riot by hundreds of persons, it is very easy\\neven to mistake one person for another, and to implicate honestly really innocent\\npersons, and even, to mistake persons seen elsewhere as having been seen there. An\\nordinary rule of caution and prudence will require that an accused person identiﬁed\\nonly by one witness, and not proved to have done any overt act, etc., as described\\nabove, should be acquitted, by giving him the beneﬁt of the doubt. (4) Where there are\\nacute factions based on either agrarian disputes and troubles or on political wrangling\\nand rivalry or on caste divisions or on divisions of the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots,\" the\\ngreatest care must be exercised before believing the evidence of a particular witness\\nbelonging to one of these factions against an accused of the opposite view.

      "[('149', 'Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in\\nprosecution of common object.\\nIf an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of\\nthe common object1 of that assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew\\nto be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the\\ntime of the committing of that offence, is a member of the same assembly, is guilty of\\nthat offence.\\nCOMMENT—\\nLiability of every member.—The Supreme Court has held that this section does not\\ncreate a separate offence but only declares the vicarious liability of all the members of\\nan unlawful assembly for acts done in prosecution of the common object of that\\nassembly or for such offences as the members of the unlawful assembly knew to be\\nlikely to be committed in prosecution of that object.82. However, Benches of a smaller\\nstrength in some cases83. have observed that section 149 creates a speciﬁc and\\ndistinct offence. Thus the law declared therein by the Benches of a smaller strength\\ncannot be taken as correct legal position.84. This section creates a speciﬁc and distinct\\noffence.85. It is not the intention of the legislature in enacting section 149 to render\\nevery member of unlawful assembly liable to punishment for every offence committed\\nby one or more of its members. In order to attract section 149, it must be shown that\\nthe incriminating act was done to accomplish the common object of unlawful\\nassembly and it must be within the knowledge of other members as one likely to be\\ncommitted in prosecution of the common object.86. A plain reading of the section\\nshows that the provision is in two parts. The ﬁrst part deals with cases in which an\\noffence is committed by any member of the assembly \"in prosecution of the common\\nobject\" of that assembly. The second part deals with cases where the commission of a\\ngiven offence is not by itself the common object of the unlawful assembly but\\nmembers of such assembly \\'knew that the same is likely to be committed in\\nprosecution of the common object of the assembly\\'.87. This section makes both the\\ncategories of persons, those who have committed the offence as also those who were\\nmembers of the same assembly liable for the offences under section 149, IPC, 1860,\\nprovided the other requirements of the section are satisﬁed. That is to say, if an offence\\nis committed by any person of an unlawful assembly, which the members of that\\nassembly knew to be likely to be committed, every member of such an assembly is\\nguilty of the offence. The law is clear that membership of unlawful assembly is\\nsuﬃcient to hold such participating members vicariously liable. For mulcting liability on\\nthe members of an unlawful assembly under section 149, it is not necessary that every\\nmember of the unlawful assembly should commit the offence in prosecution of the\\ncommon object of the assembly. Mere knowledge of the likelihood of commission of\\nsuch an offence by the members of the assembly is suﬃcient.88. Whenever the court\\nconvicts any person or persons of any offence with the aid of section 149, a clear\\nﬁnding regarding the common object of the assembly must be given and the evidence\\ndisclosed must show not only the nature of the common object but also that the object\\nwas unlawful. If members of the assembly knew or were aware of the likelihood of a\\nparticular offence being committed in prosecution of a common object, they would be\\nliable for the same under section 149.89. In the absence of such ﬁnding as also any\\novert act on the part of the accused persons, mere fact that they were armed would not\\nbe suﬃcient to prove common object.90. Where the moot question as to common\\nobjective is proved all the members of unlawful assembly would be vicariously liable\\nfor the acts done by the said assembly and thus the separate roles played by all the\\naccused persons need not be examined.91. Section 149 makes it abundantly clear that\\nif an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of\\nthe common object of that assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew\\nto be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time\\nof the committing of that offence is a member of such an assembly, is guilty of that\\noffence, however if a person is a mere bystander, and no speciﬁc role is attributed to\\nhim, he may not come under the wide sweep contemplated under section 149.92.\\nFurther where the member had no knowledge of the unlawful object of the assembly or\\nafter having gained knowledge, he attempted to prevent the assembly from\\naccomplishing the unlawful object, and after having failed to do so, he disassociated\\nhimself from the assembly, the mere participation of him in such an assembly would\\nnot be made him liable.93.\\nThe section constitutes a substantive offence.94.\\nThe Supreme Court reiterated the ambit and scope of this principle of liability as\\nfollows:\\nSection 149 IPC provides for vicarious liability. If an offence is committed by any member of\\nan unlawful assembly in prosecution of a common object thereof or such as the members\\nof that assembly knew that the offence was likely to be committed in prosecution of that\\nobject, every person who at the time of committing that offence was member would be\\nguilty of the offence committed. The common object may be commission of one offence\\nwhile there may be likelihood of commission of yet another offence, the knowledge whereof\\nis capable of being safely attributable to the members of the unlawful assembly. Whether a\\nmember of such unlawful assembly was aware as regards likelihood of commission of\\nanother offence or not would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\\nBackground of the incident, the motive, the nature of the assembly, the nature of the arms\\ncarried by the members of the assembly, their common object and the behaviour of the\\nmembers soon before, at or after the actual commission of the crime would be relevant\\nfactors for drawing an inference in that behalf.\"95. \"Common object\" means the purpose or\\ndesign shared by all the members which may be formed at any stage. It has to be\\nascertained from the acts and conduct of the individuals concerned and surrounding\\ncircumstances.96. Common object to commit a murder cannot be inferred only on the basis\\nthat the weapons carried by the accused were dangerous.97.'), ('149.1', 'Ingredients.—\\nThe section has the following essentials—\\nthe assembly; or must be such as the members of the assembly knew to be likely to be\\ncommitted. If these three elements are satisﬁed, then only a conviction under section\\n149, IPC, 1860, may be substantiated, and not otherwise.98. Section 149 shall not apply\\nto a person who is merely present in any unlawful assembly, unless he actively\\nparticipates in offence or does some overt act with the necessary criminal intention or\\nshares the common object of the unlawful assembly.99.'), ('149.2', 'Sudden action of one of the member in the assembly; all are not\\nliable:\\nTo the question whether the sudden action of one of the members of the unlawful\\nassembly constitutes an act in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful\\nassembly namely preventing of erection of the fence in question and whether the\\nmembers of the unlawful assembly knew that such an offence was likely to be\\ncommitted by any member of the assembly Supreme Court answered in the\\nnegative.100. As a consequence, the effect of section 149 of IPC, 1860, may be\\ndifferent on different members of the same unlawful assembly. Decisions of the\\nSupreme Court in Gangadhar Behera v State of Orissa and Bishnaalias\\nBhiswadebMahato v State of WB,101. similarly explained and reiterated the legal position\\non the subject.'), ('149.3', 'Sections 34 and 149.—\\nThere is a difference between object and intention, for though their object is common,\\nthe intention of the several members may differ and indeed may be similar only in\\nrespect that they are all unlawful, while the element of participation in action, which is\\nthe leading feature of section 34, is replaced in section 149 by membership of the\\nassembly at the time of the committing of the offence. Both sections deal with\\ncombinations of persons, who become punishable as sharers in an offence. Thus they\\nhave a certain resemblance and may to some extent overlap, but section 149 cannot at\\nany rate relegate section 34 to the position of dealing only with joint action by the\\ncommission of identically similar criminal acts, a kind of case which is not in itself\\ndeserving of separate treatment at all\".102. Section 34 of IPC, 1860 refers to cases in\\nwhich several persons both do an act and intend to do that act: it does not refer to\\ncases where several persons intend to do an act and some one or more of them do an\\nentirely different act. In the latter class of cases section 149 of the Code may be\\napplicable but section 34 is not.103. On the other hand, if ﬁve or more persons both do\\nan act and intend to do it, both section 34 and section 149, may apply, since the term\\n\"member\" in the singular includes the plural also (section 9). In this connection see\\ndetailed discussion and cases under sub-head \"Distinction between section 34 and\\nsection 149, IPC, 1860,\" under section 34 ante.'), ('149.4', 'Scope.—\\nThis section is not intended to subject a member of an unlawful assembly to\\npunishment for every offence which is committed by one of its members during the\\ntime they are engaged in the prosecution of the common object. It is divided into two\\nparts: (1) an offence committed by a member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution\\nof the common object of that assembly; and (2) an offence such as the members of\\nthat assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object\\nof the unlawful assembly, is one which the accused knew would be likely to be\\ncommitted in prosecution of the common object.104. The section applies equally in\\ncases where offences are committed by single member of the assembly and in cases\\nwhere offences are committed by two or more members of the assembly acting in\\nfurtherance of a common intention.105.\\nOnce the Court can ﬁnd that an offence has been committed by some member or\\nmembers of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object, then whether\\nthe principal offender has been convicted for that offence or not, upon the plain\\nwording of this section, the other members may be constructively convicted of that\\noffence, provided they are found to have had the necessary intention or knowledge. It is\\nnot correct to say that when a member of an unlawful assembly is to be found\\nconstructively guilty of an offence under this section, it must be the same offence of\\nwhich the principal is convicted and not some other offence.106.\\nMembers of an unlawful assembly may have a community of object only up to a certain\\npoint, beyond which they may differ in their objects, and the knowledge possessed by\\neach member of what is likely to be committed in prosecution of their common object\\nwill vary, not only according to the information at his command, but also according to\\nthe extent to which he shares the community of object, and as a consequence of this\\nthe effect of this section may be different on different members of the same unlawful\\nassembly.107.\\nBefore this section can be called in aid, the Court must ﬁnd with \\'certainty\\' that there\\nwere at least ﬁve persons sharing the common object. A ﬁnding that three of them\\n\\'may or may not have been there\\' betrays uncertainty on this vital point and it\\nconsequently becomes impossible to allow the conviction to rest on this uncertain\\nfoundation. This is not to say that ﬁve persons must always be convicted before this\\nsection can be applied. It is possible in some cases for Judges to conclude that though\\nﬁve were unquestionably there the identity of one or more is in doubt. In that case, the\\nconviction of the rest with the aid of this section would be good.108. Non-applicability\\nof section 149, IPC, 1860, is no bar in convicting the accused persons under section\\n302, IPC read with section 34 of IPC, if the evidence discloses commission of offence\\nin furtherance of common intention of them all. It would depend on the facts of each\\ncase as to whether section 34 or section 149 of IPC or both the provisions are\\nattracted.109. Where the accused, forming an unlawful assembly, chased and killed a\\nman by inﬂicting multiple injuries on his body with sharp edged weapons, it was held\\nthat circumstances and transaction taken as a whole were suﬃcient to invoke section\\n34 or section 149.110.\\nNo judgment can be cited as a precedent however similar the facts may be. Each case\\nmust rest on its own facts.111.\\nThe persons acting in self-defence of property cannot be members of an unlawful\\nassembly.112.\\nobject\" has to be strictly construed as equivalent to \"in order to attain the common\\nobject\". There must be community of object and the object may exist only up to a\\nparticular stage, and not thereafter. Members of an unlawful assembly may have\\ncommunity of object up to certain point beyond which they may differ in their objects\\nand the knowledge, possessed by each member of what is likely to be committed in\\nprosecution of their common object may vary not only according to the information at\\nhis command, but also according to the extent to which he shares the community of\\nobject, and as a consequence of this the effect of section 149, IPC, 1860, may be\\ndifferent on different members of the same assembly.113. The word \"knew\" as used in\\nthe second branch of section 149 implied something more than \"possibility\" and it\\ncannot bear the sense of \"might have known\". An offence committed in prosecution of\\ncommon object would generally be the offence which the members of the assembly\\nknew was likely to be committed.114. This phrase means that the offence committed\\nwas immediately connected with the common object of the unlawful assembly, of\\nwhich the accused were members. The act must be one which must have been done\\nwith a view to accomplish the common object attributed to the members of the\\nunlawful assembly. Where the common object is established, the unlawful assembly\\ndoes not cease to be so by merely splitting itself into two groups for launching the\\nattack. Section 149, IPC, 1860, would be clearly applicable to such a case.115.\\nThe words \"in prosecution of the common object\" do not mean \"during the prosecution\\nof the common object of the assembly\". It means that the offence committed was\\nimmediately connected with the common object of the assembly or the act is one\\nwhich upon the evidence appears to have been done with a view to accomplish the\\ncommon object attributed to the members of the assembly. The words \"in prosecution\\nof the common object\" have to be strictly construed as equivalent to \"in order to attain\\ncommon object\".116. In the present case,117. the common object of unlawful assembly\\nwas to kill a particular person. Two members of the assembly went after him. Sensing\\ndanger, he ran into the adjoining room to fetch a spear to defend himself. His wife\\nblocked his way and he could not come out. Frustrated, as they were, the two members\\nof the assembly gunned down two young girls of their intended victim who were then\\nplaying in the courtyard outside the house. The conviction of the rest of the members\\nfor this murder was set aside as this was neither their common object, nor incidental to\\nthat, nor necessary for its attainment.\\nVicarious responsibility can be fastened only on proof that the ultimate act was done in\\npursuance of common object.118.\\nEven where the common object is not developed at the initial stage, it may develop on\\nthe spot, eoinstanti. Thus, where it appeared that members of a party divided\\nthemselves into small groups and waited for the victim and simultaneously pounced\\nupon him and jointly removed his body, the fact that they did not assemble at one place\\nunder any plan, but came there separately, was considered by the Supreme Court to be\\nnot of much importance because at the sensitive moment they seemed to be acting in\\nan organised way.119. Where, however, the agreement speciﬁcally was only to give a\\nthrashing to the victim, but one of them pulled out a knife and stabbed the victim, it was\\nheld that neither at the initial stage nor at the execution stage, could it be said that\\nthere was the object to cause a fatal injury so as to make all others liable for the\\ndeath.120.'), ('149.5', 'Change of object.—\\nMembers who shared the original common intention may not be liable when some\\nmembers adopted a subsequently developed and aggravated common object and\\nacted on it.121.'), ('149.6', 'CASES.—Prosecution of common object.—\\nWhile membership of an unlawful assembly itself is an offence under section 143, IPC,\\n1860, use of force by members of the unlawful assembly gives rise to the offence of\\nrioting which is punishable either under section 147 or section 148, IPC. Membership\\nof the 4 accused in the unlawful assembly and use of force with dangerous weapons is\\nborne out by the evidence on record. The said facts would make the acquitted accused\\nliable for the offence under section 148 of IPC, 1860.122. Where a small compact body\\nof men armed with clubs, and headed by a man carrying a gun, endeavoured to take\\nforcible possession of certain lands, and one of the opponents was shot by their leader,\\nit was held that they were guilty of murder.123.\\nWhere in a faction- ridden village the members of one party seeing someone of the\\nother party alighting from a bus emerged together to attack him, it could be easily said\\nthat they shared the common object to assault one of their enemies and at that stage\\nthe assembly turned into an unlawful assembly.124. Where several persons assaulted\\nand caused injuries to the deceased, however except one incised injury on the head, all\\nwere lacerated injuries on legs, common object of the unlawful assembly was held to\\ncause grievous hurt and not murder and conviction of the accused was altered from\\nsections 302/ 149 to sections 326/149.125. Where the accused, being members of an\\nunlawful assembly and being armed with sharp edged weapons, used only the blunt\\nsides of their weapons, they were held to share the common object of causing grievous\\nhurt and not murder.57 Accused persons variously armed entered a police wireless\\nstation after breaking open doors and windows and assaulted inmates. Their individual\\nacts were not known. It was held that all the accused persons must be deemed to have\\nshared the common object of lurking house trespass and could be convicted under\\nsections 149/455.126. Where two innocent young girls were killed in a very gruesome\\nmanner just only to teach a lesson to their mother over a property dispute, every\\nmember of the killing team was held to be equally guilty deserving the maximum\\npenalty of death, it being a case of the \"rarest of rare\" category.127. Where the death of\\na police oﬃcer was caused while he was arresting the accused and those who caught\\nhold of him intended only to prevent him from performing his duty, but the main\\naccused suddenly killed him, it was held that the common object of the unlawful\\nassembly was to deter police from performing their duty and not to commit murder.\\nTheir conviction was altered from one under sections 302/149 to one under section\\n353/149.128. Several persons entered into a conspiracy to commit dacoity during the\\ncourse of which one of the accused ﬁred a shot which missed the target and hit one of\\nhis accomplices who died. The other accused ﬁred a shot and killed one of the inmates\\nof the house. The accused killing the inmate was convicted under sections 302 and\\nbeing dacoity and not murder.129.\\nThe accused persons were armed with lathis and guns. They declared on entry into the\\nthreshing ﬂoor mill that they had come to take away the paddy and, if the owner\\nresisted, they would take life out of him. In these circumstances they caused death. s\\nconviction under section 300 read with section 149 was held to be not illegal.130.\\nThere is no requirement for conviction under the section of assigning deﬁnite roles to\\nthe accused persons.131.'), ('149.7', 'Identiﬁcation of all the ﬁve not necessary.—\\nThe section does not require that all the ﬁve persons must be identiﬁed. Presence of\\nﬁve persons is required to be established with the common object of doing an act. The\\nfact that all of them could not be identiﬁed would not affect the application of the\\nsection. The eye-witnesses identiﬁed only four of them but testiﬁed that others were\\npresent with weapons at the time and place of occurrence.'), ('149.8', 'Unlawful assembly and the right of private defence.—\\nAs long as the accused persons exercised their right of private defence, their assembly\\ncould not be described as unlawful. But only those accused persons who shared the\\nobject of doing something in excess of the right of private defence were liable to\\nconviction with the help of section 149.132. Where the accused persons were acting in\\nthe exercise of the right of private defence, the Supreme Court said that they could not\\nbe said to have constituted an unlawful assembly. Only one of them caused an injury\\nafter the right of private defence had ceased to be available to them. They could not be\\nconvicted under section 148 with the aid of section 149.133.'), ('149.9', 'Overt act on the part of each and every member not necessary.—\\nThe presence of the accused as a part of the unlawful assembly is suﬃcient for his\\nconviction. The fact that the accused was present at the place of occurrence as a part\\nof the unlawful assembly was not disputed. That was held to be suﬃcient to hold him\\nguilty even if no overt act was attributed to him.134. This principle may not apply where\\nthe presence is such that merely by its reason the person concerned does not become\\na member of the assembly. This happened in a case in which the names of only 4\\npersons were mentioned in the complaint. Five other persons were not mentioned\\nbecause they kept standing at the back without any participation in the incident. But\\nthey were also roped in under section 149. The Supreme Court held that they could not\\nbe regarded as members of the assembly. Their conviction was impermissible.135.\\nOnce a membership of an unlawful assembly is established it is not incumbent on the\\nprosecution to establish whether any speciﬁc overt act has been assigned to any\\naccused. Mere membership of the unlawful assembly is suﬃcient and every member is\\nvicariously liable for the acts done by others either in the prosecution of the common\\nobject of the unlawful assembly or such as the members of the unlawful assembly\\nknew were likely to be committed.136.'), ('149.10', 'Inference of common object.—\\nThe common object of the unlawful assembly has to be inferred from the membership,\\nthe weapons used and the nature of the injuries as well as other surrounding\\ncircumstances. Intention of members of unlawful assembly can be gathered by nature,\\nnumber and location of injuries inﬂicted. In the instant case, repeated gun shots ﬁred\\nby one of accused person on the person of deceased and the injuries caused by lathis\\nby other accused persons on the complainant and his second brother on their heads,\\nclearly demonstrate the objective to cause murder of these persons.137. Common\\nobject to commit a murder cannot be inferred only on the basis that the weapons\\ncarried by the accused were dangerous.138. The common object of assembly is\\nnormally to be gathered from the circumstances of each case such as the time and\\nplace of the gathering of the assembly, the conduct of the gathering as distinguished\\nfrom the conduct of the individual members are indicative of the common object of the\\ngathering. Assessing the common object of an assembly only on the basis of the overt\\nacts committed by such individual members of the assembly is impermissible.139.'), ('149.11', 'Identiﬁcation of common object.—\\nThe identiﬁcation of the common object essentially requires an assessment of the\\nstate of mind of the members of the unlawful assembly. Proof of such mental\\ncondition is normally established by inferential logic. If a large number of people gather\\nat a public place at the dead of night armed with deadly weapons like axes and ﬁre\\narms and attack another person or group of persons, any member of the attacking\\ngroup would have to be a moron in intelligence if he did not know murder would be a\\nlikely consequence.140.'), ('149.12', 'No common object.—\\nA large body of men belonging to one faction waylaid another body of men belonging\\nto a second faction, and a ﬁght ensued, in the course of which a member of the ﬁrst\\nmentioned faction was wounded and retired to the side of the road, taking no further\\nactive part in the affray. After his retirement a member of the second faction was killed.\\nIt was held that the wounded man had ceased to be a member of the unlawful\\nassembly when he retired wounded, and that he could not, under this section, be made\\nliable for the subsequent murder.141. Where the accused persons rushed to the house\\nof K with a view to injure K or inmates of his house but one of the accused attacked M,\\na woman working in the house causing grievous injuries to her, the other accused\\npersons could not be held vicariously liable with the help of section 149, IPC, 1860, as it\\nwas not their common object nor had they any animus against M.142. An unlawful\\nassembly of 50 persons was alleged to have caused two deaths. There were no\\nspeciﬁc allegations against some of them, or that any criminal act was done by them in\\nfurtherance of common intention. It was held that they could not be convicted with the\\naid of either section 34 or section 149.143. When an accused leaves the place of\\noccurrence and thus ceases to be a member of the unlawful assembly, he cannot be\\nconvicted vicariously with the aid of section 149, IPC, for the murder which is\\ncommitted subsequent to his leaving the scene of crime.144. Where one member ﬁred\\non being supplied with a bullet by another only the member supplying the bullet was\\nheld liable under section 302/149 and others were convicted only under section\\n325/194, IPC.145. After a heated exchange of words, the accused went home and came\\nback with a gun accompanied by others who also armed and immediately opened ﬁre\\nat the victim causing his death. Others did not ﬁre at the victim. They ﬁred\\nindiscriminately at others injuring some people. Things happened in a very short span\\nof time. It was held that the others could not have formed an unlawful assembly with\\nthe main accused with a common object. The main culprit alone was convicted of\\nmurder.146. Where people collected outside a police-station to voice their protest over\\npolice- inaction in connection with the murder of a child, such an assembly could not\\npossibly have any common object to commit criminal trespass, arson, looting, etc., and\\nas such none could be convicted with the aid of section 149, IPC, 1860.147. All the\\naccused, armed only with lathis, caused multiple injuries to a man who died. All the\\ninjuries caused were simple in nature and were on non-vital parts of the body of the\\ndeceased, it could not be said that their common object was to kill the deceased. They\\nwere held liable to be convicted under section 304, Part II/149 and not under section\\n302/149.148.\\nWhere the common object of an unlawful assembly was to cause hurt to prosecution\\nwitnesses, and the daughter of a witness who came out from inside the house only to\\nsave her father sustained an injury at the hands of one of the accused and died, it was\\nheld that there could be no common object in the circumstances to commit murder.\\nThey were held to be guilty under section 323 read with section 149.149.'), ('149.13', 'Unlawful assembly and single witness.—\\nIn a case involving an unlawful assembly with a large number of persons, there is no\\nrule of law that states that there cannot be any conviction on the testimony of sole\\neyewitness unless that the court is of the view that testimony of such eye witness is\\nnot reliable. The rule of requirement of more than one witness applies only in a case\\nwhere a witness deposes in a general and vague manner or in the case of a riot.150.\\nDirect evidence is generally not available. The existence of common object has to be\\ngathered from the act committed and results ﬂowing from them.151.'), ('149.14', \"Conviction for section 302 s i m p l i c i t e r , when the charge was for\\nsection 302 read with section 149 of IPC, 1860:\\nThe Supreme Court in Nanak Chand v State of Punjab,152. considered the question\\nwhether there could be a conviction for the offence under section 302 simpliciter, when\\nthe charge was for the offence under section 302 read with section 149 of IPC. It was\\nheld that when there is no separate charge for the offence under section 302 simpliciter\\nand charge is only for the offence under section 302 read with 149, the conviction for\\nthe offence under section 302 simpliciter is not sustainable. In Suraj Pal v State of\\nUP,153. 19 accused were tried for the offences under sections 148, 307 and 302 read\\nwith section 149 of IPC. Sessions Court convicted all the accused. In appeal to the\\nHigh Court, ten accused were acquitted. Conviction and sentence of one accused was\\naﬃrmed for the offence under sections 148, 307 and 302. Holding that absence of\\nspeciﬁc charges against the appellant under sections 307 and section 302, IPC in\\nrespect of which he was sentenced is a very serious lacuna as framing of a speciﬁc\\nand distinct charge in respect of every distinct head of criminal liability constituting an\\noffence is the foundation for a conviction and sentence. The question was referred to\\nthe Five Judge Constitution Bench, to determine whether there was a conﬂict of view\\nbetween Nanak Chand's case (supra) and Suraj Pal's case (supra) and if so to determine\\nit in Willie Slaney v State of Madhya Pradesh.154. The Constitution Bench held that there\\nwas no conﬂict of views in the two decisions. It was held that the observations in\\nNanak Chand (supra), have to be appreciated on close examination of facts. Their\\nLordships considered the effect of a charge for constructive liability and its difference\\nwith a charge for the offence simpliciter and held that there was no prejudice and that\\nthe conviction is not invalid because of the nature of the charge. A three Judge Bench\\nin Subran v State,155. held that when the charge is under section 302 read with section\\n149 of IPC, without a speciﬁc charge having been framed for the offence under section\\n302 of IPC, as envisaged in law, an accused cannot be convicted for the substantive\\noffence under section 302 of IPC, their Lordships did not consider the Constitution\\nBench decision in Willie Slaney's case (supra). Later in the review judgment, Subran v\\nState, 1993 (3) SCC 722 , their lordships reviewed the same as follows:\\nOn a review of the judgment, we ﬁnd that the opinion expressed is capable of being\\nmisinterpreted. The opinion expressed therein was required to be conﬁned to the peculiar\\nfacts of the case, but it tends to give an impression as if it is a general exposition of law,\\nwhich it was not meant to be.\\nThe legal position in the light of the Constitution Bench decision in Willie Slaney156. is\\nclear. If the charge framed discloses the overt act committed by a particular accused,\\nthough the charge is for the offence under section 302 read with section 149 of IPC,\\n1860, and the accused faced trial with the knowledge that the prosecution case is that\\nhe committed the particular overt act which caused the death, non-framing of a distinct\\ncharge for the offence under section 302 will not cause prejudice to the accused, even\\nthough the charge framed was under section 302 read with section 149, IPC. In such a\\ncase, even though the charge is for the offence under section 302 read with section\\n149 of IPC and there is not even an alternate charge for the offence under section 302\\nsimpliciter, when the charge discloses the overt act by a particular accused which\\ncaused the death of the victim, if the evidence establishes that, that particular accused\\ninﬂicted that particular injury which caused the death, he could deﬁnitely be convicted\\nfor the offence under section 302 simpliciter. Even though there is no speciﬁc charge\\nfor section 302 simpliciter and the charge is for the offence under section 302 read\\nwith 149 of IPC, there could be a conviction under section 302 simpliciter.\"), ('149.15', 'Where no charge framed as substantive offence with aid of either\\nsection 34 and section 149.—\\nWhere participation of all the ten accused in the alleged assault on the deceased has\\nbeen proved by the evidence of witnesses, but no charge insofar as the substantive\\noffence under section 302, IPC, 1860, or under section 307, IPC with the aid of either\\nsection 34, IPC and section 149, IPC had been framed and also the evidence on record\\nis not suﬃcient to attribute any speciﬁc injury suffered by the deceased to any\\nparticular accused, acquittal of the accused of the offences under section 302, IPC or\\nunder section 307, IPC is perfectly justiﬁed.157.'), ('149.16', 'Free ﬁght and overt act.—\\nIt has been held by the Supreme Court that in a case involving free ﬁght, a conviction by\\nresorting to section 149 is not permissible.

In this section the assembly need\\nnot be an \\'unlawful assembly\\' but if it is likely to cause a disturbance of the public\\npeace, then joining or continuing in such assembly after it has been commanded to\\ndisperse is punishable. Section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Code confers on a\\nMagistrate and an oﬃcer in charge of a police-station the power to disperse an\\nunlawful assembly or any assembly of ﬁve or more persons likely to cause a\\ndisturbance of the public peace. A bare reading of section 129, Cr PC, 1973, would\\nmake it abundantly clear that a lawful procession or assembly cannot be regarded as\\nlikely to cause a breach of the peace when it is admitted that not they but some other\\nbody of persons is bent on attacking them. Whether an assembly is likely to cause a\\ndisturbance of public peace has to be judged from its own acts and behaviour and not\\nfrom the behaviour of another hostile group whose physical opposition may cause a\\nbreach of the peace.164. \"Thus, if an assembly other than an unlawful assembly\\nbehaves in such a manner as to provoke a breach of the peace by its own conduct or\\naction, there would be a justiﬁcation to order it to disperse under the powers given by\\nsection 129 of the Criminal Procedure Code. But if a religious assembly or procession\\nremains peaceful in the enjoyment of its legitimate rights and privileges under the law,\\nit should not be ordered to disperse merely because a body of antagonistic persons\\ntake it into their heads to attack it with a view to provoke a riot. In such a case, it is\\nrather that body of aggressive persons that constitutes an unlawful assembly and\\nrequires to be sternly dealt with under the law\".165. So where a peaceful group of\\npersons who were cutting crop on their own land refused to disperse on being\\ncommanded to do so by an Inspector of Police merely because another hostile group\\nobjected to the harvesting of the crop, it was held that as these persons were not\\ncommanded lawfully to disperse under section 129, Cr PC, 1973, they could not be\\nconvicted under section 151, IPC, 1860.166. In order to bring a case within the mischief\\nof this section there must be clear evidence to show that the assembly had been\\n\"lawfully commanded\" to disperse. Thus where the police oﬃcers in their evidence said\\nthat they had merely warned the two warring factions, it could not be said that the\\nassembly had been commanded to disperse and as such there was no question of\\ninvoking section 151, IPC, to prosecute the members of the assembly.167.')]\n",

He must also know or\\nbelieve what he has stated or declared is false or he has believed it true.

The ﬁrst\\nparagraph applies only to cases in which the false evidence is given in a judicial\\nproceeding, the second to all other cases. If the offence is committed in any stage of a\\njudicial proceeding it is more severely punishable than when it is committed in a non-\\njudicial proceeding.\\nIntention is the essential ingredient in the constitution of this offence. If the statement\\nwas false, and known or believed by the accused to be false, it may be presumed that\\nin making that statement he intentionally gave false evidence. In order to make a\\nperson liable for perjury it is necessary that he should have made a statement on oath\\nregarding the facts on which his statement was based and then deny those facts on\\noath on a subsequent occasion.68. The mere fact that a deponent has made\\ncontradictory statements at two different stages in a judicial proceeding is not by itself\\nalways suﬃcient to justify a prosecution for perjury under section 193 but it must be\\nestablished that the deponent has intentionally given false statement in any stage of\\nthe \\'judicial proceeding\\' or fabricated false evidence for the purpose of being used in\\nany stage of the \\'judicial proceeding\\'.69.\\nIt is not necessary that the false statement should be material to the case. The gist of\\nthe offence is the giving or fabrication of false evidence intentionally. Where knowledge\\nof falsity is proved, intention is readily presumed.70.\\n161 itself is a judicial proceeding in view of Explanation 2 to section 193 in so far as\\nrecording of a statement is part of the investigation directed by law preliminary to a\\nproceeding before a Court of justice and therefore is a stage of the judicial\\nproceedings. Mere failure to support contention made in said FIR while giving evidence\\nunder section 164 Cr PC, 1973, can\\'t conclusively lead to hold that he had given false\\nevidence by departing from contentions made in FIR.71. Where a witness in Sessions\\ntrial deposing contrary to what he had said in a statement recorded under section 164,\\nrecourse to section 340 cannot be taken without ﬁrst deciding whether the earlier\\nstatement was false.72. In the course of proceedings for execution of a decree in a\\nCourt which had no jurisdiction to entertain such proceedings the judgment-debtor\\nmade a false statement and produced a forged receipt. The Court made a complaint\\nunder section 195 of the Criminal Procedure Code for prosecution of the judgment-\\ndebtor in respect of the said offences; it was held that if during the course of the\\nproceedings which were ultra vires and illegal any offence under section 471 of the\\nCode was committed, it could not be said that it was committed in or in relation to, or\\nby a party to, any judicial proceedings, in which evidence could be legally taken, and\\ntherefore the complaint must be dismissed.73. Since enquiry conducted by an oﬃcer of\\nthe Railway Protection Force is a judicial proceeding under section 9 of The Railway\\nProperty (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966, furnishing of false documents in course of\\nsuch an enquiry would amount to an offence under section 193, IPC, 1860.74. Giving\\nfalse evidence in support of the prosecution case during the course of trial falls within\\nthe ambit of sections 193 and 195, IPC, 1860, and not under section 211, IPC, 1860, as\\nthere is no institution of criminal proceeding in such a case.75. (See Comments under\\nsub-head \"Falsely Charges\" under section 211 infra.) Where the accused abetted the\\noffence of forgery by creating a false document with a view to use it in a suit but did\\nnot use it in the suit, it was held that there was no question of prosecuting him under\\nsection 193, IPC, 1860, nor was a Court complaint under section 195(1) (b) (i), Cr PC,\\n1973, necessary in the case. The accused could be safely prosecuted under section\\n467 read with section 114, IPC, 1860, on a private complaint.76.\\nWhere the accused police-oﬃcer asked a police oﬃcial to forge the signature of his\\nsuperior on the carbon copy of the counter-aﬃdavit containing false averments and the\\nsame was ﬁled in the Supreme Court with that forged signature, the accused was held\\nguilty of an offence under section 192.77.\\nQuestions which a person is compelled to answer and the answers which have a\\ntendency to incriminate, cannot be the sole basis of a charge of perjury.78.'), ('193.1', \"Court Complaint: When?—\\nIn Iqbal Singh Marwah v Meenakshi Marwah,79. the Constitution Bench held that the\\nsection 195(1)(b)(ii) -Cr PC, 1973 which mandates that 'no Court shall take cognizance\\nof offences relating to documents given in evidence except on the complaint in writing\\nof that Court, or of some other Court to which that Court is subordinate', would be\\nattracted only when the offences enumerated in the said provision have been\\ncommitted with respect to a document after it has been produced or given in evidence\\nin a proceedings in any Court, i.e., during the time when the documents was in c u s t o d i a l \\nl e g i s .80.

Declaration in an application ﬁled under\\nsection 482 of Cr PC, 1973 that the applicant had not approached the Supreme Court\\nor the High Court earlier is not perjury, though applicant had ﬁled for anticipatory Bail\\nbefore the Sessions Court.86.'), ('193.6', \"Hostile witness.—\\nIn a prosecution under sections 489B and 489C, all prosecution witnesses who were\\npolice oﬃcials turned hostile.

Whether\\nthe accused has really made a false statement or not is a question of fact, which can\\nbe decided at the trial and not in quashing proceeding, when the allegations, which\\nhave been made against the accused do make out a prima facie case under section\\n193, IPC, 1860.90.

Furthermore, the penal provision under section\\n193 IPC, 1860 has to be understood giving signiﬁcance to the expressions 'intentionally\\ngiving or fabricating false evidence', 'in any stage of a judicial proceeding' or 'in any\\nother case.' Giving or fabricating false evidence in the aforesaid section whether it be in\\nthe judicial proceeding or in any other case must have been intended to form an\\nopinion on the evidence erroneously and such forming of opinion should be touching\\nthe point material to the result of such proceeding.

They were convicted under this section\\nbecause they gave no reasonable explanation of the unnatural death and had also\\ndisposed of the body in suspicious circumstances (dead body found near railway\\ntrack).136. The fact that the accused persons cannot be convicted for offence\\npunishable under section 302 IPC, 1860 does not extricate them from the offence\\nunder section 201 IPC, 1860.137. In a case of bride burning, where the post-mortem\\nreport was that death was due to throttling, burning her subsequently was held to be a\\nclear proof of the fact that the evidence of strangulation was sought to be destroyed by\\nthe accused husband by pouring kerosene and setting her ablaze.

The allegation against the appellant was that, he had deliberately\\nshielded the real offenders in the murder case and was accordingly liable for the\\noffence under section 201 of the IPC, 1860. Supreme Court acquitted the accused\\nholding that it is not possible on the evidence to ascertain, as to whether the appellant\\nwas, in fact, guilty of the offence alleged against him.140.\\nThe Supreme Court has held that where the evidence showed that a person had died\\nand his body was found in a trunk and discovered in a well, and that the accused had\\ntaken part in the disposal of the body but there was no evidence to show the cause of\\nhis death, or the manner or circumstances in which it came about, it was held that the\\naccused could not be convicted for an offence under this section.141.

If a\\ncase gets no further than a police inquiry, it falls within that part. But under the second\\npart there should be an actual institution of criminal proceedings on a false charge.225.\\nTwo conditions are necessary before the enhanced punishment provided in the second\\nparagraph could be inﬂicted: (1) proceedings on the false charge should have been\\nactually instituted, and (2) the false charge must be in respect of an offence punishable\\nwith death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for seven years or upwards.'), ('211.1', 'Sections 182 and 211.—\\nAccording to the Bombay High Court there is a clear distinction between a false charge\\nthat falls under section 211 and false information given to the police, in which latter\\ncase the offence falls under section 182. A person prosecuting another under section\\n182 need not prove malice and want of reasonable and probable cause except so far\\nas they are implied in the act of giving information known to be false, with the\\nknowledge or likelihood that such information would lead a public servant to use his\\npower to the injury or annoyance of the complainant. In an inquiry under section 211,\\non the other hand, proof of the absence of just and lawful ground for making the\\ncharge is an important element.226. If the information conveyed to the police amounts\\nto the institution of criminal proceedings against a deﬁned person or amounts to the\\nfalsely charging of a deﬁned person with an offence, then the person giving such\\ninformation is guilty of an offence under section 211. In such a case, section 211 is,\\nand section 182 is not, the appropriate section under which to frame a charge. Section\\n182, when read with section 211, must be understood as referring to cases where the\\ninformation given to the public servant falls short of amounting to institution of\\ncriminal proceedings against a deﬁned person and falls short of amounting to the\\nfalsely charging of a deﬁned person with an offence as deﬁned in the Penal Code.227.\\nThe Calcutta, the Madras, the Allahabad and the Patna High Courts differ from this\\nview of the Bombay High Court. The Calcutta High Court has ruled that a prosecution\\nfor a false charge may be under section 182 or section 211, but if the false charge was\\na serious one, the graver section 211 should be applied and the trial should be full and\\nfair.228. Where a false charge is made to the police of a cognizable offence the offence\\ncommitted by the person making the charge falls within the meaning of section 211\\nand not section 182.229.\\nThe Madras High Court has held that there is no error in a conviction under section 182,\\nwhen the false charge made before the police was punishable under the ﬁnal clause of\\nsection 211. The High Court may quash the conviction and sentence for the minor\\noffence and direct a trial before a tribunal having jurisdiction for the graver offence.\\nWhether it will do so, or not, is a question, not of law, but of expediency on the facts of\\nthe particular case.230.\\nThe Allahabad High Court had held that where a speciﬁc false charge is made, the\\nproper section, for proceedings to be adopted under section 211.231. Although it is\\ndiﬃcult to see what case would arise under section 211 to which section 182 could not\\nbe applied yet section 182 would apply to a case that might not fall under section 211.\\nThe offence under section 182 is complete when false information is given to a public\\nservant by a person who believes it to be false, but who intends thereby to cause such\\npublic servant to institute criminal proceedings against a third person. The offence is\\ncomplete although the public servant takes no steps towards the institution of such\\ncriminal proceedings. There is no restriction imposed by the Penal Code or by the\\nCriminal Procedure Code upon the prosecution of an offence either under section 182\\nor section 211. It appears that it has been left to the discretion of the Court to\\ndetermine when and under what circumstances prosecution should be proceeded with\\nunder sections 182 and 211.232. The soundness of this view is doubted in subsequent\\ncases.233.\\nThe Patna High Court has followed the view of the Calcutta High Court.234.\\nThe Lahore High Court has held that an offence under section 182 is included in the\\nmore serious offence under section 211 and a prosecution for a false charge may be\\neither under section 182 or section 211, though clearly if section 211 does apply and\\nthe false charge is serious, the prosecution should be under section 211.235.\\n\"proceedings\" is used in this section in the ordinary sense of a prescribed mode of\\naction for prosecuting a right or redressing a wrong. It is not used in the technical\\nsense of a proceeding taken in a Court of law.237. Neither the proceedings before the\\nDisciplinary Committee of the Bar Council of India, is a criminal proceeding nor was the\\ncharge in the Disciplinary Proceedings in relation to an offence. Charge in the\\nDisciplinary Proceedings before the Bar Council of India is only in respect of\\nprofessional misconduct and not offence as such.238. Under this section \\'instituting a\\ncriminal proceeding\\' may be treated as an offence in itself apart from \\'falsely charging\\'\\na person with having committed an offence. There are two modes in which a person\\naggrieved may seek to put the criminal law in motion: (1) by giving information to the\\npolice (Criminal Procedure Code, section 154) and (2) by lodging a complaint before a\\nMagistrate (Criminal Procedure Code, sections 190, 200). A person who sets the\\ncriminal law in motion by making to the police a false charge in respect of a cognizable\\noffence institutes criminal proceedings.239. But as the police have no power to take any\\nproceedings in non-cognizable cases without orders from a Magistrate, a false charge\\nof such offence, made to the police, is not an institution of criminal proceedings, but\\nmerely a false charge.240. The distinction between cognizable and non-cognizable\\noffences relates to the powers of the police only, and it will, therefore, seem that the\\nfalse charge of any offence, whether cognizable or non-cognizable, before a Magistrate\\nis an institution of criminal proceedings.\\ninformation\\'. The true test seems to be, does the person who makes the statement that\\nis alleged to constitute the \\'charge\\' do so with the intention and object of setting the\\ncriminal law in motion against the person against whom the statement is directed?\\nSuch object and intention may be inferred from the language of the statement and the\\ncircumstances in which it is made.241. The false charge must be made to a Court, or to\\nan oﬃcer who has power to investigate and send it up for trial.242. Where the tribunal\\nbefore whom the complaint is made is not competent to take any action direct or\\nindirect to punish the persons complained against, it cannot be said that the accused\\n\\'charged\\' such persons with any offence or that his intention necessarily was that\\naction should be taken against them.243. A false petition to the Superintendent of\\nPolice, praying for the protection of the petitioners from the oppression of a Sub-\\nInspector, which may be effected by some departmental action, does not amount to\\nsuch a false charge.244. It is enough that a false charge is made though no prosecution\\nis instituted thereon.245. Where a person who gives false information as to the\\ncommission of an offence merely states that he suspected a certain other person to be\\nthe offender, it may be that he would not be liable under this section, but where it is\\nclear that the informant\\'s intention was not merely that the police should follow up a\\nclue but that they should put the alleged offender on trial, the informant is guilty of an\\noffence under this section.246. The Calcutta High Court has held that the meaning of\\nthe expression \\'falsely charges\\' is simply \\'falsely accuses\\' and as the section stands\\nthere is no necessity of this false accusation being made in connection with a criminal\\nproceeding.247.'), ('211.2', 'Giving false Evidence: No false charge.—\\nThe words \"falsely charges\" in this section cannot mean giving false evidence against\\nthe accused as a prosecution witness during the course of a trial. To \"falsely charge\"\\nmust refer to the criminal or initial accusation putting or seeking to put in motion the\\nmachinery of criminal investigation and not when seeking to prove the false charge by\\nmaking deposition in support of the charge framed in that trial. The words \"falsely\\ncharges\" have to be read along with the expression \"institution of criminal\\nproceedings\". The false charge must, therefore, be made initially to a person in\\nauthority or to someone who is in a position to get the offender punished by\\nappropriate proceedings. In other words it must be embodied either in a complaint or in\\na report of a cognizable offence to the police-oﬃcer or to an oﬃcer having authority\\nover the person against whom the allegations are made. Giving false evidence in\\ncourse of a trial amounts to an offence under sections 193 and 195 and not under\\nsection 211, IPC, 1860.248.'), ('211.3', 'Bare statement is not false charge.—\\nA statement to the police of a suspicion that a particular person has committed an\\noffence is not a charge within the meaning of this section, nor does it amount to\\ninstitution of criminal proceedings; and a conviction cannot be had on proof that the\\nsuspicion was unfounded.249. The accused made a report to the police that his buffalo\\nhad been poisoned and that he suspected two persons whom he named of having\\nadministered the poison. The police made an inquiry and reported that there was no\\ncase of poisoning and the charge was struck off. One of the persons then brought a\\ncomplaint under this section against the accused. It was held that the report to the\\npolice did not amount to a charge of a criminal offence.250.'), ('211.4', 'Statement under section 162, Criminal Procedure Code.—\\nA statement under section 162, Criminal Procedure Code, in answer to questions put by\\na police-oﬃcer making an investigation under section 161 of the Code, cannot be made\\nthe basis of a prosecution under this section.251. False identiﬁcation in a Test\\nIdentiﬁcation Parade is not falsely charging.252.\\nthe English technical phrase \"without reasonable or probable cause,\" which means an\\nhonest belief in the guilt of the accused based upon a full conviction, founded upon\\nreasonable grounds, of the existence of a state of circumstances, which, assuming\\nthem to be true, would reasonably lead any ordinarily prudent and cautious man, placed\\nin the position of the accuser, to the conclusion that the person charged was probably\\nguilty of the crime imputed. There must be:\\nFirst, an honest belief of the accuser in the guilt of the accused;\\nSecond, such belief must be based on an honest conviction of the existence of the\\ncircumstances which led the accuser to that conclusion;\\nThird, such belief must be based upon reasonable grounds; that is, such grounds as\\nwould lead any fairly cautious man in the defendant\\'s situation so to believe;\\nFourth, the circumstances so believed and relied on by the accuser must be such as\\namount to reasonable ground for belief in the guilt of the accused.253.\\nA person may, in good faith, institute a charge that is subsequently found to be false, or\\nhe may, with intent to cause injury to an enemy, institute criminal proceedings against\\nhim, believing there are good grounds for them but in neither case has he committed\\nan offence under this section. To constitute this offence it must be shown that the\\nperson instituting criminal proceedings knew there was no just or lawful ground for\\nsuch proceedings.254.\\nIn the absence of any special circumstances to rebut it, the judgment of one competent\\ntribunal against the complainant affords very strong evidence of reasonable and\\nprobable cause.255.\\nthe Calcutta, the Madras and the Patna High Courts on the one hand, and the Allahabad\\nand the Lahore High Courts on the other, on the question whether the latter part of the\\nsection applies to such cases of complaints to the police which are disposed of\\nwithout a formal magisterial inquiry. A Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court has held\\nthat the latter part would apply to such cases where the charge related to the more\\nserious offence.256. This case is followed by the Madras257. and the Patna258. High\\nCourts. The test to apply is,—did the person who made the charge intend to set the\\ncriminal law in motion against the person on whom the charge is made.259.\\nThe Allahabad High Court has, on the other hand, held that to constitute the offence\\ndeﬁned in the second paragraph of this section, it is necessary that criminal\\nproceedings should be instituted. Where the offence committed does not go further\\nthan the making of a false charge to the police, the making of such charge does not\\namount to institution of criminal proceedings, and the offence committed will fall\\nwithin the ﬁrst paragraph, notwithstanding that the offence so falsely charged may be\\none of those referred to in the second paragraph.260. The former Chief Court of the\\nPunjab held likewise.261.'), ('211.5', 'Complaint by Court: when.—\\nA complaint alleging commission of an offence punishable under section 211 IPC,\\n1860, \"in or in relation to any proceedings in any Court\", is maintainable only at the\\ninstance of that Court or by an oﬃcer of that Court authorized in writing for that\\npurpose or some other Court to which that Court is subordinate, is abundantly clear\\nfrom the language employed in the provision.262. When the offence under section 211,\\nIPC, 1860, is committed in relation to Court proceedings, cognizance without Court\\'s\\ncomplaint is barred by section 195 (1)(b)(i), Cr PC, 1973.263. Since an order of a\\nMagistrate discharging an accused on submission of a police report under section 173,\\nCr PC, 1973, is a judicial and not administrative order, a complaint by the Magistrate or\\nhis superior Court under section 195(1)(b)(i), Cr PC, 1973, would be necessary to take\\ncognizance of an offence under section 211, IPC, 1860.264. Similarly, remand and bail\\nproceedings too have been held to be Court proceedings and as such a complaint by\\nthe Court would be necessary to take cognizance of the offence under section 211,\\nIPC, 1860.265. This view of the law has now been aﬃrmed by the Supreme Court as\\nwell.266.'), ('211.6', 'Proceedings in any Court.—\\nThere are three situations that are likely to emerge while examining the question\\nwhether there is any proceedings in any Court, namely,\\n(a) there might not be any proceeding in any Court at all,\\n(b) proceeding in a Court might actually be pending at the relevant time when\\ncognizance is sought to be taken of the offence punishable under section 211, IPC,\\n1860 and\\n(c) there might have been proceedings which had already been concluded though there\\nmight not be any proceedings pending in any Court when cognizance of offence under\\nsection 211, IPC, 1860 is taken. It is only in second and third situation that section\\n195(1), Cr PC, 1973 would apply. The fact that proceedings had been concluded would\\nnot be material because section 195(1) does not require that proceedings in any Court\\nmust actually be pending at the time when the question of applying the bar arises if the\\noffence under section 211, IPC, 1860 is alleged to have been committed in relation to\\nthose proceedings.267. A complaint by the concerned Executive Magistrate could be\\nnecessary under section 195(1)(a)(i), and there could be no suﬃcient reason for\\ndispensing with the necessity for a complaint by him for prosecution of an offence\\nunder section 211, IPC, 1860 committed in relation to a proceeding before him under\\nsection 144, Cr PC, 1973.268.'), ('211.7', 'Sections 211 and 500 IPC, 1860.—\\nIf we read sections 211 and 500 of IPC, 1860 together, we would ﬁnd a clear\\ndistinction.

Thus where a person even in order to\\npacify a situation released an accused from the lawful custody of the chowkidar by\\nuntying the turban with which the accused had been tied, it was held that the person so\\nreleasing the accused was clearly guilty of an offence under section 225, IPC, 1860, for\\nrescuing an offender from lawful custody.368.\\nOne can be held guilty for an offence under section 225 if he rescues a person who\\nwas detained lawfully. Here the word \\'rescue\\' though not deﬁned in the Code, will\\nalways mean an act of getting a person free forcibly from custody against the will of\\nperson in whose lawful custody he was. Therefore, some overt act needs to be there, if\\none is said to have rescued a person from the lawful custody.369.\\nWhere the accused obstructed the lawful apprehension of a person and wrongfully\\nconﬁned two police personnel and the evidence of the prosecution was amply\\ncorroborated and supported by medical evidence, conviction and sentence of the\\naccused under sections 225, 332 and 342 was upheld.370. The act for which the person\\nrescued is detained must amount to an offence under the Code.

It is a fact incapable of being construed or\\nseen in isolation. The preliminary conditions, thus, are that\\n(a) it is the manner in which the vehicle is driven;\\n(b) it be driven either rashly or negligently; and\\n(c) such rash or negligent driving should be such as to endanger human life.30. The\\ncriminality lies in running the risk of doing such an act with recklessness and\\nindifference to the consequences. The words \"rashly and negligently\" are\\ndistinguishable and one is exclusive of the other. The same act cannot be \"rash\" as well\\nas \"negligent\".31. Where negligence is an essential ingredient of the offence, the\\nnegligence to be established by the prosecution must be culpable or gross and not the\\nnegligence merely based upon an error of judgment. Simple lack of care such as will\\nconstitute civil liability, is not enough; for liability under the criminal law, a very high\\ndegree of negligence is required to be proved.32.\\nThere is a distinction between a rash act and a negligent act. A reckless act has to be\\nunderstood in two different senses—subjective and objective. In the subjective sense, it\\nmeans deliberate or conscious taking of an unjustiﬁed risk, which could be easily\\nforeseen and in the circumstances of the case was unreasonable to take. In the\\nobjective sense, the accused is not conscious of the result though he ought to be\\naware that it might follow and in this sense, it is almost equivalent to negligence. In\\nother words, negligence involves blameworthy heedlessness on the part of the\\naccused which a normal prudent man exercising reasonable care and caution ought to\\navoid. Negligence is an omission to do something, which a reasonable man, guided\\nupon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs,\\nwould do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. A\\nculpable rashness is acting with the consciousness that the mischievous and illegal\\nconsequences may follow, but with the hope that they will not, and often with the belief\\nthat the actor has taken suﬃcient precaution to prevent their happening. Culpable\\nnegligence is acting without the consciousness, that the illegal and mischievous effect\\nwill follow, but in circumstances which show that the actor has not exercised the\\ncaution incumbent upon him and if he had he would have had the consciousness. As\\nbetween rashness and negligence, rashness is a graver offence.33. Negligence is not\\nan absolute term but is a relative one; it is rather a comparative term. It is diﬃcult to\\nstate with precision any mathematically exact formula by which negligence, or lack of\\nit, can be infallibly measured in a given case. Whether there exists negligence per se or\\nthe course of conduct amounts to negligence will normally depend upon the attending\\nand surrounding facts and circumstances which have to be taken into consideration by\\nthe Court. In a given case, even not doing what one was ought to do can constitute\\nnegligence.34. Absence of high speed itself cannot absolve the petitioner from the\\nculpability.35.\\nThere are several offences in the Code in which the element of criminal rashness or\\nnegligence occurs, viz.,—sections 279, 280, 283–289, 304A, 336, 337, 338.\\non a public way in a manner which endangered human life or was likely to cause hurt or\\ninjury to any other person.36. It is not necessary that the rash or negligent act should\\nresult in injury to life or property.37.'), ('279.2', \"Reasonable care.—\\nThe Court has to adopt another parameter, i.e., 'reasonable care' in determining the\\nquestion of negligence or contributory negligence. The doctrine of reasonable care\\nimposes an obligation or a duty upon a person (for e.g., a driver) to care for the\\npedestrian on the road and this duty attains a higher degree when the pedestrian\\nhappen to be children of tender years. It is axiomatic to say that while driving a vehicle\\non a public way, there is an implicit duty cast on the drivers to see that their driving\\ndoes not endanger the life of the right users of the road, may be either vehicular users\\nor pedestrians. They are expected to take suﬃcient care to avoid danger to others.38.\"), ('279.3', 'Mens rea.—\\nThe essential ingredient of mens rea cannot be excluded from consideration when the\\ncharge in a criminal Court consists of criminal negligence.39.'), ('279.4', \"Res ipsa Loquitur.—\\nThis doctrine serves two purposes–one that an accident may by its nature be more\\nconsistent with its being caused by negligence for which the opposite party is\\nresponsible than by any other causes and that in such a case, the mere fact of the\\naccident is prima facie evidence of such negligence. Second, to avoid hardship in\\ncases where the claimant is able to prove the accident but cannot prove how the\\naccident occurred. The Courts have also applied the principle of res ipsa loquitur in\\ncases where no direct evidence was brought on record. Elements of this doctrine may\\nbe stated as:\\n(a) The event would not have occurred but for someone's negligence.\\n(b) The evidence on record rules out the possibility that actions of the victim or some\\nthird party could be the reason behind the event.\\n(c) Accused was negligent and owed a duty of care towards the victim.40. The principle\\nof res ipsa loquitur is only a rule of evidence to determine the onus of proof in actions\\nrelating to negligence.41. This doctrine operates in the domain of civil law especially in\\nthe cases of torts and helps in determining the onus of proof in actions relating to\\nnegligence. It cannot be pressed 'in service for determining per se the liability for\\nnegligence within the domain of criminal law. Res ipsa loquitur has, if at all, a limited\\napplication in trial on a charge of criminal negligence.42. Where a vehicle was being\\ndriven on a wrong side, accident resulting in the death of two persons, the principle of\\nres ipsa loquitur should have been applied.43. In the case of Thakur Singh v State of\\nPunjab,44. the accused drove a bus rashly and negligently with 41 passengers and while\\ncrossing a bridge, the bus fell into the nearby canal resulting in death of all the\\npassengers. The Court applied the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur since admittedly the\\npetitioner was driving the bus at the relevant time and it was going over the bridge\\nwhen it fell down.\"), ('279.5', 'Abetment.—\\nThe mere fact that petitioner was the owner of the offending vehicle at the relevant\\ntime, ipso facto is not a cogent ground to array him as an accused under section 109\\nIPC, 1860. In this manner, no offence of abetment is made out against the petitioner.45.'), ('279.6', 'Difference between civil and criminal liability.—\\nThere can be no civil action for negligence if the negligent act or omission has not been\\nattended by an injury to any person; but bare negligence involving the risk of injury is\\npunishable criminally, though nobody is actually hurt by it.\\nIf actual hurt is caused the case would come under sections 337 or 338, and if death is\\ncaused, under section 304A.46.\\nIn a case of collision or injury arising out of rash driving, the actual driver and not the\\nowner of the carriage is liable under this section;47. whereas, in a civil suit, the injured\\nparty has an option to sue either or both of them. In a criminal case, every man is\\nresponsible for his own act; there must be some personal act.48.'), ('279.7', 'Mechanical failure.—\\nPoor maintenance of vehicle is itself a negligent act.49. In cases where the prosecution\\nalleges that the brakes were defective, it must establish by evidence that the brakes\\nwere so defective that the driving of the vehicle endangered human life or was likely to\\ncause hurt or injury to any other person. Merely because the vehicle swerved to the\\nright when its brakes were pulled up, it could not be said that there was danger to\\nhuman life or it was likely to cause hurt or injury to others.50.

By Act 36 of 1969, section\\n292 was amended to give more precise meaning to the word \\'obscene\\' as used in the\\nsection in addition to creating an exception for publication of matter which is proved to\\nbe justiﬁed as being for the public good, being in the interest of science, literature, art\\nor learning or other objects of general concern. Prior to its amendment, section 292\\ncontained no deﬁnition of obscenity. The amendment also literally does not provide for\\na deﬁnition of \\'obscenity\\' in as much as it introduces a deeming provision.108. In order\\nto make the law relating to the publication of obscene matters or objects deterrent, the\\nsection provides for enhanced punishment. The Exception to the original section, which\\nis now redrafted, exempts from the provisions of the section any representation,\\nsculptured, engraved or painted on or in any ancient monument. The possession\\nreferred to in this section connotes conscious possession.109. By Act 25 of 1960, the\\nState of Tamil Nadu has added a new section as section 292A for dealing with printing,\\nof grossly indecent or scurrilous matter or matter intended for blackmail. The State of\\nOrissa has followed suit by Act 13 of 1962. The intention of the Legislature while\\namending the provision is to deal with this type of offences which corrupt the mind of\\nthe people to whom objectionable things can easily reach and need not be emphasized\\nthat corrupting inﬂuence is more likely to be upon the younger generation who has got\\nto be protected from being easy prey.110. This section was amended by Act XXXVI\\nwhen apart from enlarging the scope of the exceptions, the penalty was enhanced\\nwhich was earlier up to three months or with ﬁne or with both. By the amendment a\\ndichotomy of penal treatment was introduced for dealing with the ﬁrst offenders and\\nthe subsequent offenders. In the case of even a ﬁrst conviction, the accused shall be\\npunished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two\\nyears and with ﬁne which may extend to Rs 2,000.111.\\nwas originally used to describe anything disgusting, repulsive, ﬁlthy or foul. The use of\\nthe word is now said to be somewhat archaic or poetic; and it is ordinarily restricted to\\nsomething offensive to modesty or decency, or expressing or suggesting unchaste or\\nlustful ideas, or being impure, indecent, or lewd.112. The obscene matter in a book must\\nbe considered by itself and separately to ﬁnd out whether it is so gross and its\\nobscenity, so decided, that it is likely to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are\\nopen to inﬂuences of this sort and into whose hands the book is likely to fall. In this\\nconnection, the interests of our contemporary society and particularly the inﬂuence of\\nthe book on it must not be overlooked.113. It was further observed in this case that\\nmerely treating with sex and nudity in art and literature cannot be regarded as evidence\\nof obscenity without something more. It was held that where obscenity and art are\\nmixed, art must be so preponderating as to throw the obscenity into the shadow or the\\nobscenity so trivial and insigniﬁcant that it can have no effect and may be overlooked.\\nWhen treatment of sex becomes offensive to public decency and morality as judged by\\nthe prevailing standards of morality in the society, then only the work may be regarded\\nas an obscene production.114. In considering the question of obscenity of a publication\\nwhat the Court has to see is that whether a class, not an isolated case, into whose\\nhands the book, article or story falls suffer in their moral outlook or become depraved\\nby reading it or might have impure and lecherous thoughts aroused in their minds.115. It\\nwas also observed in this case that the question of obscenity may have to be judged in\\nthe light of the claim that the work has a predominant literary merit. Referring to the\\nimpact on the mind of the youth, the Court said:116.\\nWe do not think that it can be said with any assurance that merely because the adolescent\\nyouth read situations of the type presented in the book, they would become deprived,\\ndebased and encouraged to lasciviousness. It is possible that they may come across such\\nsituations in life and may have to face them. But if a narration or description of a similar\\nsituation is given in a setting emphasising a strong moral to be drawn from it and condemns\\nthe conduct of the erring party as wrong and loathsome, it cannot be said that they have a\\nlikelihood of corrupting the morals of, those in whose hands it is likely to fall—particularly\\nthe adolescent.\\nIn KA Abbas v UOI,117. the Supreme Court has called the test laid down in Mishkin\\'s\\ncase118. as \\'selective audience obscenity test\\' and observed as:\\nour standards must be so framed that we are not reduced to a level where the protection of\\nthe least capable and the most depraved amongst us determines what the morally healthy\\ncannot view or read ….\\nThe requirements of art and literature include within themselves a comprehensive view of\\nsocial life and not only in its ideal form and the line is to be drawn where the average moral\\nman begins to feel embarrassed or disgusted at a naked portrayal of life without the\\nredeeming touch of art or genius or social value. If the depraved begins to see in these\\nthings more than what an average person would, in much the same way, as it is wrongly\\nsaid, a Frenchman sees a woman\\'s legs in everything, it cannot be helped. In our scheme of\\nthings ideas having redeeming social or artistic value must also have importance and\\nprotection for their growth.\\nIn the case of Samaresh Bose v Amal Mitra119. wherein the Supreme Court provided the\\nfollowing guidance:120.\\nIn our opinion, in judging the question of obscenity, the judge in the ﬁrst place should try to\\nplace himself in the position of the author and from the view point of the author the judge\\nshould try to understand what is it that the author seeks to convey and what the author\\nconveys has any literary and artistic value. The judge should thereafter place himself in the\\nposition of a reader of every age group in whose hands the book is likely to fall and should\\ntry to appreciate what kind of possible inﬂuence the book is likely to have in the minds of\\nthe readers. The judge should thereafter apply his judicial mind dispassionately to decide\\nwhether the book in question can be said to be obscene within the meaning of the section\\nby an objective assessment of the book as a whole and also of the passages complained of\\nas obscene separately.\\nIt is no defence to a charge of obscenity merely to urge that the information has been\\ncopied from similar works.121.\\nIn Promilla Kapur (Dr) v Yash Pal Bhasin, Promilla Kapur (Dr) v Yash Pal Bhasin,122. the\\nDelhi High Court felt123. that there was nothing wrong if a sociologist made a research\\non the subject of call-girls in order to know the reasons as to why and how the young\\ngirls fall in this profession and what society could do in order to eradicate or at least\\nminimise the possibility of young budding girls joining the ﬂesh trade. The book was in\\nthe form of interviews with the girls in the profession. The portion marked by the\\nMagistrate as obscene was a description of their encounters with unscrupulous males\\nincluding a description by some girls of their ﬁrst experience with sex. But by far the\\nbulk of the book dealt with the ways and means of running the profession and the\\nmethods of encountering them. Thus, the book was within the scope of clause (a) of\\nthe ﬁrst exception. In Bobby Art International v Om Pal Singh Hoon,124. while examining\\nthe validity of certiﬁcate of exhibition awarded to the ﬁlm \"Bandit Queen\" it was held\\nthat nakedness does not always arouse the baser instinct. In Director General,\\nDirectorate General of Doordarshan v Anand Patwardhan,125. the Supreme Court again\\nreferred to the Hicklin test and observed that the relevant questions are:\\n(a) whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would\\nﬁnd that the work, taken as a whole appeal to the prurient interest.\\n(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual\\nconduct speciﬁcally, deﬁned by the applicable state law,\\n(c) whether the work taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or\\nscientiﬁc value.\\nIn the case of Ajay Goswami v UOI,126. the Supreme Court, while recognizing the right of\\nadult entertainment, reviewed the position of law on obscenity and summarized the\\nvarious tests laid down regarding obscenity.'), ('292.1', \"A picture of a woman in the nude is not per se obscene.—\\nUnless the picture of a nude/semi-nude female is an incentive to sensuality or impure\\nor excite the thoughts in the mind of an ordinary person of normal temperament, the\\npictures cannot be regarded as obscene within the meaning of section 292 IPC, 1860.\\nBut where repetitive photographs without any backdrop content are published in a\\nmagazine and nearly l/4th of the magazine consists of nothing but repetitive\\nphotographs of semi-nude women, prominence being to display their breast, there\\nbeing hardly any literary contents in the magazine, the matter loses any literary content\\nand therefore the broad social outlook penned in Ranjit Udeshi's case127. may not be\\navailable as a defence.128. To fall within the scope of 'obscene' under sections 292 and\\n294 IPC, the ingredients of the impugned matter/art must lie at the extreme end of the\\nspectrum of the offensive matter. The legal test of obscenity is satisﬁed only when the\\nimpugned art/matter can be said to appeal to an unhealthy, inordinate person having\\nperverted interest in sexual matters or having a tendency to morally corrupt and debase\\npersons likely to come in contact with the impugned art.129.\"), ('292.2', 'Hicklin Test and Community Standard Test.—\\nOne of the tests to be applied to ﬁnd whether an article possesses the standard of\\nobscenity is the Hicklin Test.130. As per this, the test of obscenity is whether the\\ntendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose\\nminds are open to such immoral inﬂuences and into whose hands a publication of this\\nsort may fall. The other test is Community Standard Test, whereby the obscenity has to\\nbe judged from the point of view of an average person, by applying contemporary\\ncommunity standards. In Aveek Sarkar v State of WB,131. the Supreme Court was of the\\nview that Hicklin test is not the correct test to be applied to determine \"what is\\nobscenity\".\\nWhen the name of Mahatma Gandhi is alluded or used as a symbol, speaking or using\\nobscene words, the concept of \"degree\" comes in. To elaborate, the \"contemporary\\ncommunity standards test\" becomes applicable with more vigour, in a greater degree\\nand in an accentuated manner.132.'), ('292.3', \"Khushboo Case.—\\nIn Khushboo v Kanniammal,133. the appellant, a popular actress expressed her personal\\nopinion wherein she had noted the increasing incidence of pre-marital sex, especially in\\nthe context of live-in relationships and called for the societal acceptance of the same.\\nHowever, appellant had also qualiﬁed her remarks by observing that girls should take\\nadequate precautions to prevent unwanted pregnancies and the transmission of\\nvenereal diseases. The Supreme Court said it failed to see how the appellant's remarks\\namount to 'obscenity' in the context of section 292 IPC, 1860. It was diﬃcult to\\nappreciate the claim that the statements published as part of the survey were in the\\nnature of obscene communications.\"), ('292.4', \"Meaning of the word obscene in sections 292, 293 and section\\n294(b).—\\nThe word 'obscene' is not deﬁned differently in these sections but the punishments\\nwere prescribed differently in other sections depending upon the effect of 'obscenity'\\nthat causes on the viewer or hearer as the case may be. That also would suﬃciently\\nindicate that the said word is to be understood as understood for the purpose of\\nsection 292.134.\"), ('292.5', 'Certiﬁcate of Censor Board.—\\nOnce the ﬁlm is given a particular certiﬁcation, no doubt the case of obscenity under\\nsection 292 of the IPC, 1860, cannot be made out when the said ﬁlm is shown to the\\nparticular category for which the certiﬁcate is granted. Again, the pre-condition is that\\nthere has to be a certiﬁcation by the Board of Film Censors. In the absence of any such\\ncertiﬁcate, the petitioners cannot claim immunity from prosecution under section 292\\nof the IPC.135. In GP Lamba v Tarun Mehta,136. explaining the role of the Censor Board\\ncertiﬁcate,137. the Court said:\\nThe law presumes the regular performance of oﬃcial acts. This is not to suggest that the\\ngrant of a certiﬁcate debars the court from judging the obscenity of a ﬁlm..... or that the\\ncertiﬁcate is conclusive.... such a certiﬁcate is the opinion of a high powered Board\\nespecially entrusted with power to screen off the silver screen pictures which offensively\\ninvade or deprave public morale through over-sex... The rebuttable presumption, which\\narises in favour of the statutory certiﬁcate, can be negatived by positive evidence. No such\\nevidence was before the court.138.\\nIn the matter of sex knowledge, the Court said:\\nIn the present day society in India, a book, picture or a publication which deals with such\\nmatter cannot per se be said to be obscene.139.\\nThe Court further added that in order to satisfy the requirement of mens rea there must\\nbe a distinct ﬁnding that the matter complained of was inserted by the order or owing\\nto the negligence of the proprietor.140.'), ('292.6', \"Public interest.—\\nAn obscene advertisement was published in a daily. The advertiser said that the\\npublication was intended in good faith to promote sale of condoms. The advertisement\\nwas withdrawn because of social objections. The advertiser also apologised. The\\ncomplaint ﬁled by a social worker was no doubt maintainable but it was quashed\\nbecause the complainant's interest should give way to the larger public interest as to\\nwhether prosecution would be proper in the circumstances of the case.141.\"), ('292.7', 'For sale.—\\nPossession of obscene objects is punishable if the possession is for the purpose of\\nsale, hire, distribution, public exhibition or circulation. Persons who were found viewing\\nobscene ﬁlms on television with the help of VCR could not be charged for the offence\\npunishable under section 292.142.'), ('292.8', 'Effect upon children.—\\nThe accused could not be convicted of possessing an indecent photograph unless he\\nknew that he had the photograph in his possession. The \"making\" of an indecent\\nphotograph included copying, downloading or storing it on a computer, provided that it\\nwas done knowingly.143.'), ('292.9', \"Pornography, incitement for supply of material.—\\nAct of accused, privately viewing obscene ﬁlm does not constitute on offence under\\nsection 292 of IPC, 1860.144. Mere possession of an obscene cassette by itself does\\nnot amount to an offence punishable under section 292(2) IPC. In the case on hand, the\\naccused was found managing a video shop wherein obscene cassette containing a\\nblue-ﬁlm evidently kept for hire to the potential customers, was found. In such\\ncircumstances, it cannot be said that the possession of the cassette was without the\\nrequisite mens rea or that it and does not attract the ingredients of the offence\\npunishable under section 292 IPC.145. In another case, it was proved that the accused\\nshowed pornographic ﬁlm on the handicam to the prosecutrix. Though the charge of\\nrape failed, conviction under sections 292 and 506 was upheld.146.\\nGenerally, evidence of expert is inadmissible whether an article or book has a tendency\\nto deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to read, hear or see the matter in\\nquestion.147. The only exception is where the likely readers belong to a special class\\nsuch as young children,148. In Samaresh Base's case149. the Supreme Court of India\\nconsidered the evidence of two eminent Bengali novelists to determine whether the\\nbook 'Prajapati', a Bengali novel, has a tendency to deprave and corrupt youth, who are\\nlikely to read it and having regard to their evidence decided the case in favour of the\\naccused. It was however held that, though a Court of law may consider the views of\\nreputed authors or leading literatures, the ultimate duty to make a proper assessment\\nregarding obscenity or otherwise of a book rests only with the Court.150. The\\nprosecution need not prove something which the law does not burden it with. As\\nregards the second part of the guilty act (actus reus), i.e. the selling or keeping for sale\\nan object which is found to be obscene, here of course the ordinary mens rea is\\nrequired to be shown before the offence can be said to be complete. Even so, it was\\nheld in this case that in criminal prosecution mens rea must necessarily be proved by\\ncircumstantial evidence alone unless the accused confesses. Thus, it is not required\\nthat prosecution must prove guilty intention to possess or possess for sale, by positive\\nevidence. The Court will presume that the owner of the shop is guilty if the book is sold\\non his behalf and later found to be obscene unless he can establish that the sale was\\nwithout his knowledge or consent. Thus to escape liability he has to prove his lack of\\nknowledge.151. In India, it is also a defence to plead a certiﬁcate given by the Board of\\nCensors. Thus, a certiﬁcate granted by the Board of Censors under section 5A of the\\nCinematograph Act 1952, certifying a ﬁlm to be ﬁt for public exhibition, circulation or\\ndistribution would by virtue of section 79, IPC, 1860, make prosecution under section\\n292, IPC, unsustainable even if the ﬁlm be obscene, lascivious or tending to deprave or\\ncorrupt public morale. This is so as section 79, IPC, (justiﬁcation on ground of bona ﬁde\\nmistake of fact) is exculpatory when read with section 5A of the Cinematograph Act\\nand the certiﬁcate issued thereunder.152.\"), ('292.10', 'Obscenity in the internet and other electronic mediums.—\\nsection 67 of the Information Technology Act 2000 is the ﬁrst statutory provisions\\ndealing with obscenity on the Internet in India. Sections 67, 67A and 67B of the\\nInformation Technology Act 2000 deal with obscenity in electronic sphere.\\nIt must be noted that the both under IPC, 1860, and the Information Technology Act,\\n2000, the test to determine obscenity is similar.153.\\nA special law shall prevail over the general and prior laws. Electronic forms of\\ntransmission is covered by the IT Act, which is a special law. When the Act in various\\nprovisions deals with obscenity in electronic form, it covers the offence under section\\n292 IPC, 1860. Once the special provisions having the overriding effect do cover a\\ncriminal act and the offender, he gets out of the net of the IPC and in this case, section\\n292 IPC, 1860. Though charge has not been made out under section 67 of the IT Act,\\nyet the accused-appellant could not be proceeded under section 292 IPC.154.\\nState Amendments\\n(Section 292-A insertion)\\nOrissa.— The following amendments were made by Orissa Act No. 13 of 1962, s. 3 (w.e.f.\\n16-5-1962).\\nIn its application to the whole State of Orissa, after Section 292, insert the following\\nnew section, namely:—\\n292-A.

By Act 36 of 1969 the punishment for the offence is\\nfurther enhanced. On going through section 293, it is clear that a separate penal\\nprovision was made with regard to the sale, exhibition, of such obscene object to any\\nperson under the age of 20 years where as section 292 (1) deals with sale, exhibition,\\nof such obscene object to any person. Therefore, in order to make the provision more\\nstringent and grave insofar as it relates to the sale, of obscene objects to younger\\npersons–aged less than 20 years, a separate penal provision, made applicable in\\nsection 293, was introduced. It is in that context, the word \\'obscene\\' occurring in\\nsection 292(1) is made applicable to section 293 also.158. In a trial for the offences\\nunder sections 292 and 293 of the IPC, 1860, a certiﬁcate granted under section 6 of\\nthe Cinematograph Act by the Board of Censors does not provide an irrebuttable\\ndefence to accused who have been granted such a certiﬁcate, but it is certainly a\\nrelevant fact of some weight to be taken into consideration by the criminal Court in\\ndeciding whether the offence charged is established. The Court must have regard to\\nthe fact that the certiﬁcate represents the judgment of a body of persons particularly\\nselected under the statute for the speciﬁc purpose of adjudging the suitability of ﬁlms\\nfor public exhibition, and that judgment extends to a consideration of the principal\\ningredients which go to constitute the offences under sections 292 and 293 of the IPC,\\nwhether the ingredients are established is primarily and essentially its own function,\\nand it cannot abdicate that function in favour of another, no matter how august and\\nqualiﬁed be the statutory authority.159.'), ('293.1', 'CASE.—\\nSCC 43 [LNIND 1979 SC 428] .\\n[LNIND 2013 SC 82] ; Uttam Singh v The State (Delhi Administration, (1974) 4 SCC 590 [LNIND\\n1974 SC 113] : 1974 SCC (Cr) 626 : AIR 1974 SC 1230 [LNIND 1974 SC 113] : 1974 (3) SCR 722\\n[LNIND 1974 SC 113] : 1974 Cr LJ 423 ; Bharat Bhushan v State of Punjab, reported in 1999 (2)\\nRCR (Cr) 148.\\nThe allegation is that the petitioner was a spectator of the blue-ﬁlm and therefore an\\nabettor of the offences under sections 292, 293 and 294 IPC, 1860.

To fall within the scope of 'obscene' under sections 292\\nand 294 IPC, 1860, the ingredients of the impugned matter/art must lie at the extreme\\nend of the spectrum of the offensive matter. The legal test of obscenity is satisﬁed only\\nwhen the impugned art/matter can be said to appeal to an unhealthy, inordinate person\\nhaving perverted interest in sexual matters or having a tendency to morally corrupt and\\ndebase persons likely to come in contact with the impugned art. It must also be\\nremembered that a piece of art may be vulgar but not obscene. In order to arrive at a\\ndispassionate conclusion where it is crucial to understand that art from the perspective\\nof the painter, it is also important to picture the same from a spectator's point of view\\nwho is likely to see it.164. The obscene act or song must cause annoyance. Though\\nannoyance is an important ingredient of this offence, it being associated with mental\\ncondition, has often to be inferred from proved facts. Thus, where a Doctor was ﬁlthily\\nabused in a public place by dragging the name of his wife and he and some members\\nof the public were impelled to complain to the police, it was held that there was\\nsuﬃcient indication of the fact that they were all annoyed even though it was not stated\\nor spoken to by them in their evidence.165.\"), ('294.1', 'Public Place.—\\nHotels like the one where cabaret dances are performed and entry is restricted by\\npurchase of the tickets, would still be the public places within the meaning of section\\n294 of the IPC, 1860.166.

It is either (A) lawful, or (B)\\nunlawful.\\n(A) Lawful homicide, or simple homicide, includes several cases falling under the\\nGeneral Exceptions (Chapter IV).\\n(B) Unlawful homicide includes—\\n(1) Culpable homicide not amounting to murder (section 299).\\n(2) Murder (section 300).\\n(3) Rash or negligent homicide (section 304A).\\n(4) Suicide (sections 305, 306).\\n(A) Lawful or simple homicide.—This is committed where death is caused in one of the\\nfollowing ways:—\\nintention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act, in a lawful manner, by lawful\\nmeans, and with proper care and caution (section 80).\\n(i) By a person, who is bound, or by mistake of fact in good faith believes\\nhimself bound, by law (section 76).\\n(ii) By a Judge when acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or\\nwhich in good faith he believes to be, given to him by law (section 77).\\n(iii) By a person acting in pursuance of the judgment or order of a Court of\\nJustice (section 78).\\n(iv) By a person who is justiﬁed or who by reason of a mistake of fact, in good\\nfaith, believes himself to be justiﬁed by law (section 79).\\n(v) By a person acting without any criminal intention to cause harm and in\\ngood faith, for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person\\nor property (section 81).\\n(vi) Where death is caused in the exercise of the right of private defence of\\nperson or property (sections 100, 103).\\nperson as will come under sections 82, 83, 84 and 85.\\nof the person killed, when—\\n(i) he or, if a minor or lunatic, his guardian, has expressly or impliedly\\nconsented to such an act (sections 87, 88); or\\n(ii) where it is impossible for the person killed to signify his consent or where\\nhe is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian from whom it is\\npossible to obtain consent, in time for the thing to be done with beneﬁt\\n(section 92).\\n(B) Unlawful homicide.—Culpable homicide is the ﬁrst kind of unlawful homicide. It is\\nthe causing of death by doing:\\n(i) an act with the intention of causing death;\\n(ii) an act with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;\\nor\\n(iii) an act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause death.\\nWithout one or other of those elements, an act, though it may be in its nature criminal\\nand may occasion death, will not amount to the offence of culpable homicide.1.\\nCulpable homicide may be classiﬁed in three categories—(1) in which death is caused\\nby the doing of an act with the intention of causing death; (2) when it is committed by\\ncausing death with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause\\ndeath; and (3) where the death is caused by an act done with the knowledge that such\\nact is likely to cause death. Knowledge and intention should not be confused. Section\\n299 in deﬁning ﬁrst two categories does not deal with the knowledge whereas it does\\nin relation to the third category. It would also be relevant to bear in mind the import of\\nthe terms \"likely by such act to cause death\". Herein again lies a distinction as \"likely\"\\nwould mean probably and not possibly. When an intended injury is likely to cause death,\\nthe same would mean an injury which is suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to\\ncause death which in turn would mean that death will be the most probable result.2.'), ('299.1', 'Ingredients.—\\nThe section has the following essentials:\\n(i) with the intention of causing death; or\\n(ii) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;\\nor\\n(iii) with the knowledge that the doer is likely by such act to cause death.\\nThe fact that the death of a human being is caused is not enough. Unless one of the\\nmental states mentioned in ingredient3. is present, an act causing death cannot\\namount to culpable homicide.'), ('299.2', \"'Causes death'.—\\nDeath means the death of a human being (section 46). But this word does not include\\nthe death of an unborn child (vide Explanation 3). It is immaterial if the person whose\\ndeath has been caused is not the very person whom the accused intended to kill: see\\nIllustration (a) and section 301.4. The offence is complete as soon as any person is\\nkilled. Death occurs when brain dies completely. A person cannot be said dead if some\\nbrain activity is present.5.\"), ('299.3', \"Five-step enquiry.—\\nAccording to the Supreme Court, in case where death is alleged to have been caused\\nby a person, there shall be a ﬁve-step inquiry:\\n(i) Is there a homicide? (ii) If yes, is it a culpable homicide or a 'not culpable homicide'? (iii) If\\nit is a culpable homicide, is the offence one of culpable homicide amounting to murder (s.\\n300 of the Indian Penal Code) or is it a culpable homicide not amounting to murder (s. 304\\nof the Indian Penal Code)? (iv) If it is a 'not culpable homicide' then a case u/s. 304-A of the\\nIndian Penal Code is made out. (v) If it is not possible to identify the person who has\\ncommitted the homicide, the provisions of s. 72 of the Indian Penal Code may be invoked.6.\"), ('299.4', '\\'By doing an act with the intention of causing death\\'.—\\nNone of the endless variety of modes by which human life may be cut short before it\\nbecomes in the course of nature extinct, is excluded. Death may be caused by\\npoisoning, starving, striking, drowning, and by a hundred different ways.\\nUnder section 32, words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions, and\\nthe word \"illegal\" is applicable to everything which is an offence or which is prohibited\\nby law, or which furnishes ground for a civil action (section 43). Therefore, death\\ncaused by illegal omission will amount to culpable homicide.7.'), ('299.5', 'Need for viscera report.—\\nHaving noticed that, in several cases, where poisoning is suspected, the prosecuting\\nagencies are not taking steps to obtain viscera report, the Supreme Court, in Joshinder\\nYadav v State of Bihar8. issued certain directions in this behalf.

The prosecuting agencies should ensure\\nthat the viscera is, in fact, sent to the FSL for examination and the FSL should ensure\\nthat the viscera is examined immediately and report is sent to the investigating\\nagencies/Courts post-haste. If the viscera report is not received, the concerned Court\\nmust ask for explanation and must summon the concerned oﬃcer of the FSL to give an\\nexplanation as to why the viscera report is not forwarded to the investigating\\nagency/Court.

But the phrase \\'with the knowledge that he is likely by such act\\nto cause death\\' includes all cases of rash acts by which death is caused, for rashness\\nimports a knowledge of the likely result of an act which the actor does in spite of the\\nrisk.\\nBoth the expressions \"intent\" and \"knowledge\" occurring in section 299 postulate\\nexistence of a positive mental attitude which is of different degrees. Further, such\\nmental attitude towards consequences of conduct is one of intention and knowledge. If\\ndeath is caused in any of the circumstances envisaged in section 299, offence of\\nculpable homicide is said to have been committed.14.'), ('299.11', 'Distinction between knowledge and intention.—\\nKnowledge denotes a bare state of conscious awareness of certain facts in which the\\nhuman mind might itself remain supine or inactive whereas intention connotes a\\nconscious state in which mental faculties are roused into activity and summed up into\\naction for the deliberate purpose of being directed towards a particular and speciﬁc\\nend which the human mind conceives and perceives before itself. Intention need not\\nnecessarily involve premeditation. Whether there is such an intention or not is a\\nquestion of fact.15.'), ('299.12', \"Death caused without 'requisite intention' or 'knowledge' not\\nculpable homicide.—\\nIf the death is caused under circumstances speciﬁed in section 80, the person causing\\nthe death will be exonerated under that section. But, if it is caused in doing an unlawful\\nact, the question arises whether he should be punished for causing it. The Code says\\nthat when a person engaged in the commission of an offence causes death by pure\\naccident, he shall suffer only the punishment of his offence, without any addition on\\naccount of such accidental death. See Illustration (c) to this section. The offence of\\nculpable homicide supposes an intention, or knowledge of likelihood of causing death.\\nIn the absence of such intention or knowledge, the offence committed may be grievous\\nhurt,16. or simple hurt.17. It is only where death is attributed to an injury which the\\noffender did not know would endanger life or would be likely to cause death and which\\nin normal conditions would not do so notwithstanding death being caused, that the\\noffence will not be culpable homicide but grievous or simple hurt. Every such case\\ndepends upon the existence of abnormal conditions unknown to the person who\\ninﬂicts the injury.18. A person who voluntarily inﬂicts injury such as to endanger life\\nmust always, except in the most extraordinary and exceptional circumstances, be taken\\nto know that he is likely to cause death. If the victim is actually killed, the conviction in\\nsuch cases ought ordinarily to be of the offence of culpable homicide.19. Once it is\\nestablished that an act was a deliberate act and was not the result of accident or\\nrashness or negligence, it is obvious that the offence would be culpable homicide.20.\"), ('299.13', 'Death due to diseased spleen.—\\nWhere the accused gave a blow with a light bamboo stick, not more than an inch in\\ndiameter, to the deceased who was suffering from diseased spleen on the region of\\nthat organ, it was held that he was guilty of causing grievous hurt.21.'), ('299.14', 'CASES.—Knowledge of probable consequence of act.—Beating.—\\nWhere a person struck with a heavy stick and killed a man, being at the time under the\\nbona ﬁde belief that the object at which he struck was not a human being but\\nsomething supernatural, but through terror, having taken no steps to satisfy himself\\nthat it was not a human being, he was held to have committed culpable homicide.22.'), ('299.15', \"Explanation 1.—\\nA person causing bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease, or\\nbodily inﬁrmity, and thereby accelerating the death of that other, is deemed to have\\n'caused his death'.

The reason for this\\nprovision is obvious that it is not always that proper remedies and skilful treatment are\\nwithin the reach of a wounded man.24.\\nAlthough proof be given that the wound or other bodily injury if skilfully treated might not\\nhave resulted in death, yet, if in fact death is the result, the wound 'causes' death. And it\\ndoes not avail the offender to prove that the ﬁrst cause might have been removed or\\nrendered inoperative by the application of proper remedies and that death might have been\\nprevented. 'Proper remedies and skilful treatment' may not be within the reach of the\\nwounded man; or if they are at hand, he may be unable or unwilling to resort to them. But\\nthis is immaterial so far as it relates to the due interpretation of the words 'cause of death'.\\nThe primary cause which sets in motion some other cause,—as the severe wound which\\ninduces gangrene or fever, and the ultimate effect, death, are suﬃciently connected as\\ncause and effect, notwithstanding that the supervening sickness or disease might have\\nbeen cured by medical skill. All that it is essential to establish is that the death has been\\ncaused by the bodily injury and, if there be any intervening cause, that it is connected with a\\nsuﬃcient degree of probability with the primary one.25.\\nIf death results from an injury voluntarily caused, the person who causes that injury is\\ndeemed to have caused death although the life of the victim might have been saved if\\nproper medical attention had been given, and even if medical treatment was given but\\nwas not the proper treatment, provided that it was administered in good faith by a\\ncompetent physician or surgeon.26.\"), ('299.17', 'CASES.—\\nWhere the deceased did not actually die from the injuries but died from the gangrene\\nwhich set in inconsequence of some dirty substance, such as a bandage or the da with\\nwhich the injuries were caused, coming into contact with one injury, although the\\ninjuries were not the direct cause of death, the person causing the injuries was held to\\nhave caused death.27. Where the facts were that the acts of the accused were in the\\ncategory of a rash act which brought about dashing against the victim leading to his\\ndeath. There appeared to be no intention or knowledge of bringing about a fatal\\nconsequence.

Each\\nof the four clauses requires that the act which causes death should be done\\nintentionally, or with the knowledge or means of knowing that death is a natural\\nconsequence of the act. An intention to kill is not always necessary to make out a case\\nof murder. A knowledge that the natural and probable consequence of an act would be\\ndeath will suﬃce for a conviction under section 302, IPC, 1860.31.\"), ('300.1', 'Scope.—\\nAn offence cannot amount to murder unless it falls within the deﬁnition of culpable\\nhomicide; for this section merely points out the cases in which culpable homicide is\\nmurder. But an offence may amount to culpable homicide without amounting to\\nmurder.\\nIt does not follow that a case of culpable homicide is murder, because it does not fall\\nwithin any of the Exceptions to section 300. To render culpable homicide murder, the\\ncase must come within the provisions of clauses 1, 2, 3, or 4 of section 300 and must\\nnot fall within any one of the ﬁve Exceptions attached thereto.'), ('300.2', 'Culpable homicide and murder distinguished.—\\nThe distinction between these two offences is very ably set forth by Melvill, J, in\\nGovinda\\'s case32. and by Sarkaria, J, in Punnayya\\'s case.33. Since the decision of the\\nSupreme Court is the law of the land by virtue of Article 141 of the Constitution,\\nrelevant passages from Punnayya\\'s case are reproduced below for the guidance of all\\nconcerned.\\nIn the scheme of the Penal Code, \\'culpable homicide\\' is genus and \\'murder\\' its specie. All\\n\\'murder\\' is \\'culpable homicide\\' but not vice versa. Speaking generally \\'culpable homicide\\nsans \\'special characteristics of murder\\' is culpable homicide not amounting to murder\\'. For\\nthe purpose of ﬁxing punishment, proportionate to the gravity of this generic offence, the\\nCode practically recognises three degrees of culpable homicide. The ﬁrst is, what may be\\ncalled, culpable homicide of the ﬁrst degree. This is the gravest form of culpable homicide\\nwhich is deﬁned in s. 300 as \\'murder\\'. The second may be termed as \\'culpable homicide of\\nthe second degree\\'. This is punishable under the 1st part ofs. 304. Then, there is \\'culpable\\nhomicide of the third degree\\'. This is the lowest type of culpable homicide and the\\npunishment provided for it is also the lowest among the punishments provided for the three\\ngrades. Culpable homicide of this degree is punishable under the Second Part of s. 304.\\nThe academic distinction between \\'murder\\' and \\'culpable homicide not amounting to\\nmurder\\' has vexed the Courts for more than a century. The confusion is caused, if\\nCourts losing sight of the true scope and meaning of the terms used by the legislature\\nin these sections allow themselves to be drawn into minute abstractions. The safest\\nway of approach to the interpretation and application of these provisions seems to be\\nkeeping in focus the key words used in the various clauses of sections 299 and 300.\\nThe following comparative table will be helpful in appreciating the points of distinction\\nbetween the two offences.\\nSection 299 Section 300\\nA person commits culpable homicide if the act\\nby which the death is caused is done -\\nSubject to certain exceptions, culpable\\nhomicide is murder if the act by which the\\ndeath is caused is done -\\nINTENTION\\n(a) with the intention of causing death; or (1) with the intention of causing death; or\\n(b) with the intention of causing such bodily\\ninjury as is likely to cause death; or\\n(2) with the intention of causing such bodily\\ninjury as the offender knows to be likely to\\ncause the death of the person to whom the\\nharm is caused; or\\n(3) with the intention of causing bodily injury to\\nany person and the bodily injury intended to be\\ninﬂicted is suﬃcient in the ordinary course of\\nnature to cause death; or\\nKNOWLEDGE\\n(c) with the knowledge that the act is likely to\\ncause death.\\n(4) with the knowledge that the act is so\\nimminently dangerous that it must in all\\nprobability cause death or such bodily injury as\\nis likely to cause death, and without any excuse\\nor incurring the risk of causing death or such\\ninjury as is mentioned above.\\nClause (b) of section 299 corresponds with clauses (2) and (3) of section 300. The\\ndistinguishing feature of the mens rea requisite under clause (2) is the knowledge\\npossessed by the offender regarding the particular victim being in such a peculiar\\ncondition or state of health that the intentional harm caused to him is likely to be fatal,\\nnotwithstanding the fact that such harm would not in the ordinary way of nature be\\nsuﬃcient to cause death of a person in normal health or condition. It is noteworthy that\\nthe \\'intention to cause death\\' is not an essential requirement of clause (2). Only the\\nintention of causing the bodily injury coupled with the offender\\'s knowledge of the\\nlikelihood of such injury causing the death of the particular victim is suﬃcient to bring\\nthe killing within the ambit of this clause. This aspect of clause (2) is borne out by\\nIllustration (b) appended to section 300.\\nClause (b) of section 299 does not postulate any such knowledge on the part of the\\noffender. Instances of cases falling under clause (2) of section 300 can be where the\\nassailant causes death by a ﬁst blow intentionally given knowing that the victim is\\nsuffering from an enlarged liver, or enlarged spleen or diseased heart and such blow is\\nlikely to cause death of that particular person as a result of the rupture of the liver, or\\nspleen or the failure of the heart, as the case may be. If the assailant had no such\\nknowledge about the disease or special frailty of the victim, nor an intention to cause\\ndeath or bodily injury suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the\\noffence will not be murder, even if the injury which caused the death, was intentionally\\ngiven.\\nIn clause (3) of section 300, instead of the words, \\'likely to cause death\\' occurring in the\\ncorresponding clause (b) of section 299, the words \"suﬃcient in the ordinary course of\\nnature\" have been used. Obviously, the distinction lies between a bodily injury likely to\\ncause death and a bodily injury suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\\ndeath. The distinction is ﬁne but real, and, if overlooked, may result in miscarriage of\\njustice. The difference between clause (b) of section 299 and clause (3) of section 300\\nis one of the degree of probability of death resulting from the intended bodily injury. To\\nput it more broadly, it is the degree of probability of death which determines whether a\\nculpable homicide is of the gravest, medium or the lowest degree. The word \"likely\" in\\nclause (b) of section 299 conveys the sense of \\'probable\\' as distinguished from a mere\\npossibility. The words \\'bodily injury... suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\\n\\'death\\' mean that death will be the most probable result of the injury, having regard to\\nthe ordinary course of nature.\\nFor cases to fall within clause (3), it is not necessary that the offender intended to\\ncause death, so long as the death ensues from the intentional bodily injury or injuries\\nsuﬃcient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.\\nClause (c) of section 299 and clause (4) of section 300 both require knowledge of the\\nprobability of the act causing death. It is not necessary for the purpose of this case to\\ndilate much on the distinction between these corresponding clauses. It will be\\nsuﬃcient to say that clause (4) of section 300 would be applicable where the\\nknowledge of the offender as to the probability of death of a person in general as\\ndistinguished from a particular person or persons being caused from his imminently\\ndangerous act, approximates to a practical certainty. Such knowledge on the part of the\\noffender must be of the highest degree of probability, the act having been committed\\nby the offender without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury\\nas aforesaid.34.\\nIn Ajit Singh v State of Punjab,35. the Supreme Court observed that:\\nIn order to hold whether an offence would fall u/s. 302 or s. 304 Part I of the Code, the\\nCourts have to be extremely cautious in examining whether the same falls u/s. 300 of the\\nCode which states whether a culpable homicide is murder, or would it fall under its ﬁve\\nexceptions which lay down when culpable homicide is not murder.\\nIn other words, section 300 states both, what is murder and what is not. First ﬁnds\\nplace in section 300 in its four stated categories, while the second ﬁnds detailed\\nmention in the stated ﬁve Exceptions to section 300. The legislature in its wisdom,\\nthus, covered the entire gamut of culpable homicide \\'amounting to murder\\' as well as\\nthat \\'not amounting to murder\\' in a composite manner in section 300 of the Code.36.\\nFrom the above conspectus, it emerges that whenever a Court is confronted with the\\nquestion of whether the offence is \\'murder\\' or \\'culpable homicide not amounting to\\nmurder\\' on the facts of a case, it will be convenient for it to approach the problem in\\nthree stages. The question to be considered at the ﬁrst stage would be, whether the\\naccused has done an act by doing which he has caused the death of another. Proof of\\nsuch causal connection between the act of the accused and the death leads to the\\nsecond stage for considering whether that act of the accused amounts to \"culpable\\nhomicide\" as deﬁned in section 299. If the answer to this question is prima facie found\\nin the aﬃrmative, the stage for considering the operation of section 300, IPC, 1860, is\\nreached. This is the stage at which the Court should determine whether the facts\\nproved by the prosecution bring the case within the ambit of any of the four clauses of\\nthe deﬁnition of \\'murder\\' contained in section 300. If the answer to this question is in\\nthe negative, the offence would be \\'culpable homicide not amounting to murder\\',\\npunishable under the ﬁrst or the second part of section 304, depending, respectively, on\\nwhether the second or the third clause of section 299 is applicable. If this question is\\nfound in the positive, but the case comes within any of the Exceptions enumerated in\\nsection 300, the offence would still be \\'culpable homicide not amounting to murder\\',\\npunishable under the ﬁrst part of section 304, IPC, 1860.\\nThe above are only broad guidelines and not cast-iron imperatives. In most cases, their\\nobservance will facilitate the task of the Court. But sometimes the facts are so\\nintertwined and the second and the third stages so telescoped into each other, that it\\nmay not be convenient to give a separate treatment to the matters involved in the\\nsecond and third stages.\\nTo sum up:\\nSection 299 is divided into three parts. The ﬁrst part refers to the act by which the death is\\ncaused by being done with the intention of causing death. That part corresponds to the ﬁrst\\npart of the section 300, IPC. The second part of section 299, IPC speaks of the intention to\\ncause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. This has corresponding provisions in\\nclauses \"Secondly\" and \"Thirdly\" of section 300, IPC, section 304, Part I, IPC, covers cases\\nwhich by reason of the Exceptions under section 300, IPC, are taken out of the purview of\\ncls. (1), (2) and (3) of section 300, IPC, but otherwise would fall within it and also cases\\nwhich fall within the second part of section 299 but not within section 300 clauses (2) and\\n(3). The third part of section 299 corresponds to \"fourthly\" of section s. 300. Section 304,\\nPart-II, IPC, covers those cases which fall within the third part of section 299 but do not fall\\nwithin the fourth clause of section 300.37.\\nSection 300 states both, what is murder and what is not. First ﬁnds place in section\\n300 in its four stated categories, while the second ﬁnds detailed mention in the stated\\nﬁve Exceptions to section 300. The legislature in its wisdom, thus, covered the entire\\ngamut of culpable homicide \\'amounting to murder\\' as well as that \\'not amounting to\\nmurder\\' in a composite manner in section 300 of the Code.38.'), ('300.3', \"Clause 1.— 'Act by which the death is caused is done with the\\nintention of causing death'.—\\nThe word 'act' includes omission as well (section 33). Any omission by which death is\\ncaused will be punishable as if the death is caused directly by an act.39. Thus, where a\\nperson neglected to provide his child with proper sustenance although repeatedly\\nwarned of the consequences and the child died, it was held to be murder.40. Intention\\nto cause death may be revealed by the whole circumstances of the story.\"), ('300.4', 'Honour Killing.—\\nIn Shakti Vahini v UOI,41. the Supreme Court observed that honour killing is not the\\nsingular type of offence. It is a grave one but not the lone one. It is a part of honour\\ncrime. Honour crime is the genus and honour killing is the species, although a\\ndangerous facet of it. In Arumugam Servai v State of TN,42. the Supreme Court strongly\\ndeprecated the practice of khap/katta panchayats taking law into their own hands and\\nindulging in offensive activities which endanger the personal lives of the persons\\nmarrying according to their choice.43. Law Commission of India studied the matter and\\nsubmitted the 242nd report to the Government. Some proposals are being mooted\\nproposing amendments to section 300, IPC, 1860 by way of including what is called\\n\\'Honour Killing\\' as murder and shifting the burden of proof to the accused. But the\\nCommission expressed the view that there is no need for introducing a provision in\\nsection 300, IPC, 1860 in order to bring the so called \\'honour killings\\' within the ambit of\\nthis provision. According to the report, the existing provisions in IPC, 1860 are\\nadequate enough to take care of the situations leading to overt acts of killing or\\ncausing bodily harm to the targeted person who allegedly undermined the honour of\\nthe caste or community. The commission suggested a new law (instead of amending\\nIPC, 1860) to tackle the problem namely \"Prohibition of Interference with the Freedom\\nof Matrimonial Alliances Bill 2011\".44.\\nIn Shakti Vahini v UOI,45. the Supreme Court observed that torture or torment or ill-\\ntreatment in the name of honour that tantamounts to atrophy of choice of an individual\\nrelating to love and marriage by any assembly is illegal and cannot be allowed a\\nmoment of existence. In this case, the Supreme Court issued detailed preventive,\\nremedial and punitive directives to prevent honour killings in the country.'), ('300.5', 'Clause 2.—\\'With the intention of causing such bodily injury as the\\noffender knows to be likely to cause the death\\'.—\\nThis clause applies where the act by which death is caused is done with the intention\\nof causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the\\nperson to whom the harm is caused. It applies in special cases where the person\\ninjured is in such a condition or state of health that his or her death would be likely to\\nbe caused by an injury which would not ordinarily cause the death of a person in sound\\nhealth and where the person inﬂicting the injury knows that owing to such condition or\\nstate of health it is likely to cause the death of the person injured. In a case involving\\nattack with sulphuric acid causing \"grievous injury\" where the doctor testiﬁed that such\\nan attack may also cause death, the Court said that \"the word likely means \\'probably\\'\\nand can easily be distinguished from \\'possibly\\'. When the chances of a thing happening\\nare very high, we say that it will most probably happen\".46.'), ('300.6', 'Poisoning.—\\nIn a case of murder by poisoning, the prosecution must establish (1) that death took\\nplace by poisoning, (2) that the accused had the poison in his possession, and (3) that\\nthe accused had an opportunity to administer poison to the deceased.47. These\\npropositions were laid down by the Supreme Court in Dharambir Singh v State of Punjab,\\nCriminal Appeal No. 98 of 1958, decided, Nov. 4, 1958 SC48. and were given anxious\\nconsideration by Hidayatullah, J, in Anant Chintaman Lagu v State of Bombay.49. The\\nlearned judge (afterwards CJ) did not consider them as invariable criteria of proof to be\\nestablished by the prosecution in every case of murder by poisoning. This is so\\n\"because\", as the learned judge said:\\nevidently if after poisoning the victim, the accused destroyed all traces of the body, the ﬁrst\\nproposition would be incapable of being proved except by circumstantial evidence. Similarly,\\nif the accused gave a victim something to eat and the victim died immediately on the\\ningestion of that food with symptoms of poisoning and poison, found in the viscera, the\\nrequirement of proving that the accused was possessed of the poison would follow the\\ncircumstance that the accused gave the victim something to eat and need not be separately\\nproved.\\nFollowing this opinion in the case of Bhupinder Singh v State of Punjab50. and\\ndispensing with the need for proof of possession of poison, the Supreme Court said\\nthat:\\nwe do not consider it necessary that there should be acquittal on the failure of the\\nprosecution to prove possession of poison with the accused. Murder by poison is invariably\\ncommitted under the cover and cloak of secrecy. Nobody will administer poison to another\\nin the presence of others. The person who administers poison..... will not keep a portion of it\\nfor the investigating oﬃcer to come and collect it.... [He] would naturally take care to\\neliminate and destroy the evidence against him.... It would be impossible for the\\nprosecution to prove possession of poison with the accused. The prosecution may,\\nhowever, establish other circumstances consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of\\nthe accused. The Court then would not be justiﬁed in acquitting the accused on the ground\\nthat the prosecution has failed to prove possession of poison with the accused.\\nContinuing further, Shetty, J said:\\nThe poison murder cases are not to be put outside the rule of circumstantial evidence.\\nThere may be very many obvious facts and circumstances in which the Court may be\\njustiﬁed in drawing permissible inference that the accused was in possession of the poison\\nin question.... The insistence on proof of possession of poison... invariably in every case is\\nneither desirable nor practicable. It would mean to introduce an extraneous ingredient to the\\noffence of murder by poisoning.\\nWhere, therefore, neither motive nor administration of poison nor its possession by the\\naccused could be proved, the accused had to be acquitted.51. Where it is proved that\\nthe accused administered poison, the accused must be presumed to have knowledge\\nthat his act was likely to cause death.52. If the prosecution failed to prove the cause of\\ndeath, the fact that the accused failed to explain the cause of death cannot be the\\nbasis of conviction. Accused was acquitted where neither post-mortem report nor FSL\\nreport showed the administration of poison.53. Where the allegation was that the death\\nwas caused by poison mixed with alcohol, but no remnants of poisonous substance\\nwere found either in the two bottles or in the steel glass but were found only in the\\nearth so collected from the place of occurrence, accused acquitted.54.'), ('300.7', \"Possibility of survival of deceased.—\\nThe Supreme Court has observed that a chance of miraculous survival is not\\ncontemplated by section 300. The attacker becomes liable if he knew that his victim\\nwould die as a result of the injuries caused by him. The doctor's opinion that the victim\\ncould have survived if timely and proper medical aid was provided is a hypothetical\\nproposition.55.\"), ('300.8', \"Clause 3.—'With the intention of causing bodily injury to any person ...\\nsuﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death'.—\\nThe distinction between this clause and clause 2 of section 299 depends upon the\\ndegree of probability of death from the act committed. If from the intentional act of\\ninjury committed the probability of death resulting is high, the ﬁnding will be that the\\naccused intended to cause death, or injury suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to\\ncause death; if there was probability in a less degree of death ensuing from the act\\ncommitted, the ﬁnding will be that the accused intended to cause injury likely to cause\\ndeath.56. In the case of Mangesh v State of Maharashtra,57. the Supreme Court stated\\nthe circumstances from which it may be gathered as to whether there was intention to\\ncause death. It included circumstances like nature of the weapon; on what part of the\\nbody the blow was given; the amount of force; was it a result of a sudden ﬁght or\\nquarrel; whether the incident occurred by chance or was pre-meditated; prior animosity;\\ngrave and sudden provocation; heat of passion; did the accused take any undue\\nadvantage; did he act cruelly; number of blows given, etc. Even if none of the injuries by\\nitself was suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, cumulatively such\\ninjuries may be suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.58.\"), ('300.9', '\"Bodily injury\".—\\nThe expression \"bodily injury\" in clause thirdly includes also its plural, so that the clause\\nwould cover a case where all the injuries intentionally caused by the accused are\\ncumulatively suﬃcient to cause the death in the ordinary course of nature, even if none\\nof those injuries individually measures up to such suﬃciency. The suﬃciency spoken of\\nin this clause, as already noticed, is the high probability of death in the ordinary course\\nof nature, and if such suﬃciency exists and death is caused and the injury causing it is\\nintentional, the case would fall under clause thirdly of section 300. All the conditions\\nwhich are a prerequisite for the applicability of this clause have been established and\\nthe offence committed by the accused, in the instant case was \"murder\".59.\\nWhat is required for the prosecution to prove to bring the case under clause thirdly to\\nsection 300? First, it must be established, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is\\npresent; Second, the nature of the injury must be proved and these are purely objective\\ninvestigations; third, it must be proved that there was an intention to inﬂict that\\nparticular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that\\nsome other kind of injury was intended; and once these three elements are proved to\\nbe present, the enquiry proceeds further; and fourth, it must be proved that the injury of\\nthe type just described made up of the three elements set out above is suﬃcient to\\ncause death in the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective\\nand inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender. Once these four\\nelements are established by the prosecution (and, of course, the burden is on the\\nprosecution throughout) the offence is murder under section 300 \"thirdly\". Once the\\nintention to cause the bodily injury actually found to be present is proved, the rest of the\\nenquiry is purely objective and the only question is whether, as a matter of purely\\nobjective inference, the injury is suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\\ndeath.60. On this particular point, there is the following pertinent observation of the\\nSupreme Court:61.\\nThe nature of the offence does not depend merely on the location of the injury caused by\\nthe accused. The intention of the person causing the injury has to be gathered from a\\ncareful examination of the facts and circumstances of each given case….\\nThe Supreme Court also observed that the intention to cause the requisite type of injury\\nis a subjective inquiry, but that once that type of intention is found in the assailant, the\\nfurther inquiry whether the injury was suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to\\ncause death is of objective nature.62.'), ('300.10', 'Principle of exclusion.—\\nIn Rampal Singh v State of UP,63. after referring to the pronouncements in Rayavarapu\\nPunnayya (supra), Vineet Kumar Chauhan v State of UP,64. Ajit Singh v State of Punjab,65.\\nand Mohinder Pal Jolly v State of Punjab,66. the Supreme Court opined thus:\\nThe evidence led by the parties with reference to all these circumstances greatly helps the\\nCourt in coming to a ﬁnal conclusion as to under which penal provision of the Code the\\naccused is liable to be punished. This can also be decided from another point of view i.e. by\\napplying the \"principle of exclusion\". This principle could be applied while taking recourse to\\na two- stage process of determination. First, the Court may record a preliminary ﬁnding if\\nthe accused had committed an offence punishable under the substantive provisions of s.\\n302 of the Code, that is, \"culpable homicide amounting to murder\". Then second, it may\\nproceed to examine if the case fell in any of the Exceptions detailed in s. 300 of the Code.\\nThis would doubly ensure that the conclusion arrived at by the Court is correct on facts and\\nsustainable in law. We are stating such a proposition to indicate that such a determination\\nwould better serve the ends of criminal justice delivery.67.\\nThe third clause of section 300 views the matter from a general standpoint. Here, the\\nemphasis is on the suﬃciency of the injury in the ordinary course of nature to cause\\ndeath. The suﬃciency is the high probability of death in the ordinary way of nature.\\nWhen this suﬃciency exists and death follows and the causing of such injury is\\nintended, the offence is murder. Sometimes the nature of the weapon used, sometimes\\nthe part of the body on which the injury is caused and sometimes both are relevant.68.\\nIn some cases, the suﬃciency of injury to cause death in the ordinary course of nature\\nmust be proved and cannot be inferred from the fact that death has in fact taken place.\\nIn such a case, it may not be open to argue backwards from the death to the blow, to\\nhold that the suﬃciency is established because death did result. As death can take\\nplace from other causes, the suﬃciency is required to be proved by other and separate\\nevidence.69.'), ('300.11', 'Contradiction between ocular and medical evidence.—\\nWhere there is a contradiction between medical evidence and ocular evidence, the\\nposition of law can be crystallised to the effect that though the ocular testimony of a\\nwitness has greater evidentiary value vis-à-vis medical evidence, when medical\\nevidence makes the ocular testimony improbable, that becomes a relevant factor in the\\nprocess of the evaluation of evidence. However, where the medical evidence goes so\\nfar that it completely rules out all possibility of the ocular evidence being true, the\\nocular evidence may be disbelieved.70. The opinion given by a medical witness need\\nnot be the last word on the subject. Such opinion shall be tested by the Court. If the\\nopinion is bereft of logic or objectivity, Court is not obliged to go by that opinion. After\\nall, opinion is what is formed in the mind of a person regarding a fact situation. If one\\ndoctor forms one opinion and another doctor forms a different opinion on the same\\nfacts, it is open to the judge to adopt the view which is more objective or probable.\\nSimilarly, if the opinion given by one doctor is not consistent with probability, the Court\\nhas no liability to go by that opinion merely because it is said by the doctor. Of course,\\ndue weight must be given to opinions given by persons who are experts in the\\nparticular subject.71.

Clause \"Secondly\" is subjective to the\\noffender. It must, of course, ﬁrst be found that bodily injury was caused and the nature\\nof the injury must be established, that is to say, whether the injury is on the leg or the\\narm or the stomach, how deep it penetrated, whether any vital organs were cut and so\\nforth. These are purely objective facts and leave no room for inference or deduction: to\\nthat extent the enquiry is objective; but when it comes to the question of intention, that\\nis subjective to the offender and it must be proved that he had an intention to cause the\\nbodily injury that is found to be present. First part of clause \"Thirdly\" envisages\\ninﬂiction of bodily injury with the intention to inﬂict it, i.e., it must be proved that the\\ninjury found to be present was the injury that was intended to be inﬂicted. Whether it\\nwas suﬃcient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature is a matter of inference\\nor deduction from the proven facts about the nature of the injury and has nothing to do\\nwith the question of intention.75.'), ('300.15', \"Clause 4.—'Person committing the act knows that it is so imminently\\ndangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as\\nis likely to cause death'.—\\nWhere it is clear that the act by which the death is caused is so imminently dangerous\\nthat the accused must be presumed to have known that it would, in all probability,\\ncause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, then unless he can meet\\nthis presumption his offence will be culpable homicide, and it would be murder unless\\nhe can bring it under one of the Exceptions.76.

However, there may be cases where the\\nnon-explanatiosn of the injuries by the prosecution may not affect the prosecution\\ncase.

(2) In India,\\nwords and gestures may also, under certain circumstances, cause grave and sudden\\nprovocation to an accused so as to bring his act within the First Exception to section\\n300 of the Indian Penal Code.\\n(3) The mental background created by the previous act of the victim may be taken into\\nconsideration in ascertaining whether the subsequent act caused grave and sudden\\nprovocation for committing the offence.\\n(4) The fatal blow should be clearly traced to the inﬂuence of passion arising from that\\nprovocation and not after the passion had cooled down by lapse of time, or otherwise\\ngiving room and scope for premeditation and calculation.\\nKM Nanavati v State of Maharashtra.90.\\nAn offence resulting from grave and sudden provocation would normally mean that a\\nperson placed in such circumstances could lose self-control but only temporarily and\\nthat too, in proximity to the time of provocation. The provocation could be an act or\\nseries of acts done by the deceased to the accused resulting in inﬂicting of injury.91.\\nThe test of \"grave and sudden\" provocation is whether a reasonable man, belonging to\\nthe same class of society as the accused, placed in the situation in which the accused\\nwas placed would be so provoked as to lose his self-control. Words and gestures may\\nalso, under certain circumstances, cause grave and sudden provocation to an accused\\nso as to bring his act within the Exception. The mental background created by the\\nprevious act of the victim may be taken into consideration in ascertaining whether the\\nsubsequent act caused grave and sudden provocation for committing the offence. The\\nfatal blow should be clearly traced to the inﬂuence of passion arising from that\\nprovocation and not after the passion had cooled down by lapse of time, or otherwise\\ngiving room and scope for premeditation and calculation.92.'), ('300.20', 'Self-control.—\\nThis term as it appears in section 300, Exception 1 is a subjective phenomenon and\\ncan be inferred from the surrounding circumstances in a given case. In order to ﬁnd out\\nwhether the last act of provocation on which the offender caused the death was\\nsuﬃciently grave to deprive the accused of the power of self-control, the previous acts\\nof provocation caused by the person can always be taken into consideration.93.'), ('300.21', 'Grave and Sudden: Cases.—\\nWhere there is suﬃcient time for cooling down, there would be no sudden provocation\\nand the act of the accused would be a deliberate one. Thus, where the accused after\\nreceiving the provocation in a school committee meeting went to his house, brought a\\ngun and thereafter shot chasing ﬂeeing men, his action did not fall within this exception\\nbut was an act of murder.94.\\nWhat is critical for a case to fall under Exception 1 to section 300, IPC, 1860 is that the\\nprovocation must not only be grave but sudden as well. It is only where the following\\ningredients of Exception 1 are satisﬁed that an accused can claim mitigation of the\\noffence committed by him from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder:\\n(1) The deceased must have given provocation to the accused.\\n(2) The provocation so given must have been grave.\\n(3) The provocation given by the deceased must have been sudden.\\n(4) The offender by reason of such grave and sudden provocation must have been\\ndeprived of his power of self-control; and\\n(5) The offender must have killed the deceased or any other person by mistake or\\naccident during the continuance of the deprivation of the power of self-control.95.'), ('300.22', \"Doctrine of, and acts amounting to, sustained provocation.—\\nWhat Exception 1 of section 300 contemplates is a grave and sudden provocation\\nwhereas the ingredient of sustained provocation is a series of acts more or less grave\\nspread over a certain period of time, the last of which acting as the last straw breaking\\na camel's back may even be a very triﬂing one. Where the accused had killed an\\ninnocent woman and an infant of a family merely on the suspicion of illicit intimacy\\nbetween his wife and the father of the deceased infant and his suspicion appeared to\\nbe more imaginary than real, it was held that there was practically no ground to invoke\\nthis doctrine. Besides, as there was nothing to support his suspicion and there was no\\nenmity between the accused and the deceased either, the plea of sustained\\nprovocation was not tenable under section 300, Exception 1.96.\"), ('300.23', 'Adulterous intercourse.—\\nA man in love with a woman who had repulsed his suit might be so angry as to lose\\ncontrol of himself at the sight of her engaged in sexual intercourse with another, but if\\nhe kills one or both of them, he cannot plead grave provocation in mitigation of his\\noffence.

The authors of the Code observed:\\nWherever the limits of the right of private defence may be placed, and with whatever degree\\nof accuracy they may be marked, we are inclined to think that it will always be expedient to\\nmake a separation between murder and... voluntary culpable homicide in defence.\\nThe chief reason for making this separation is that the law itself invites men to the very\\nverge of the crime which we have designated as voluntary culpable homicide in defence. It\\nprohibits such homicide indeed; but it authorizes acts which lie very near to such homicide;\\nand this circumstance, we think, greatly mitigates the guilt of such homicide.\\nThat a man who deliberately kills another in order to prevent that other from pulling his nose\\nshould be allowed to go absolutely unpunished would be most dangerous. The law\\npunishes and ought to punish such killing; but we cannot think that the law ought to punish\\nsuch killing as murder; for the law itself has encouraged the slayer to inﬂict on the assailant\\nany harm short of death which may be necessary for the purpose of repelling the outrage; to\\ngive the assailant a cut with a knife across the ﬁngers which may render his right hand\\nuseless to him for life, or to hurl him downstairs with such force as to break his leg; and it\\nseems diﬃcult to conceive that circumstances which would be a full justiﬁcation of any\\nviolence short of homicide should not be a mitigation of the guilt of homicide. That a man\\nshould be merely exercising a right by fracturing the skull and knocking out the eye of an\\nassailant, and should be guilty of the highest crime in the Code if he kills the same assailant;\\nthat there should be only a single step between perfect innocence and murder, between\\nperfect impunity and liability to capital punishment, seems unreasonable. In a case in which\\nthe law itself empowers an individual to inﬂict any harm short of death, it ought hardly, we\\nthink, to visit him with the highest punishment if he inﬂicts death.102.'), ('300.27', 'When the offender is not entitled to get the beneﬁt of this exception.\\n—\\nA fortiori in cases where an accused sets up right of private defence, the ﬁrst and the\\nforemost question that would fall for determination by the Court would be whether the\\naccused had the right of private defence in the situation in which death or other harm\\nwas caused by him. If the answer to that question is in the negative, Exception 2 to\\nsection 300 of the Code would be of no assistance. Exception 2 presupposes that the\\noffender had the right of private defence of person or property but he had exceeded\\nsuch right by causing death. It is only in case answer to the ﬁrst question is in the\\naﬃrmative, viz., that the offender had the right of defence of person or property, that\\nthe next question, viz., whether he had exercised that right in good faith and without\\npremeditation and without any intention of doing more harm that was necessary for the\\npurpose of such defence would arise.

Right of private defence has been rightly discarded.107. After an\\naltercation and exchange of abuses, two persons aimed riﬂes at each other.

To ward off an attack with a stick, a stab wound\\npuncturing the heart is not justiﬁed. It is a clear case of offence under section 304, Part\\nI, IPC, 1860.110. So also is the case of killing an unarmed trespasser with chhura blows\\nwhich punctured both the heart and the lung.111.\\nA dispute over lease of agricultural land led to murder. The accused appeared armed\\nwith deadly weapons. Two persons were killed in separate incidents. The Court said\\nthat this indicated that there was pre-meditation. The acts done showed that there was\\nintention to do more harm than was necessary for the purposes of self-defence. Hence,\\nthe offences were not in the category of culpable homicide not amounting to\\nmurder.112.\\nThe Court found that at some point of time, the accused (appellant) was exercising his\\nright of private defence, but that had ceased to exist long before the time when the\\ndeadly blow was administered.

The obligation to\\nprove an exception is on the preponderance of probabilities but it nevertheless lies on\\nthe defence.116.'), ('300.32', 'Exception 4.—Death caused in sudden ﬁght.—\\nA perusal of the provision would reveal that four conditions must be satisﬁed to bring\\nthe matter within Exception 4:\\n(i) it was a sudden ﬁght;\\n(ii) there was no premeditation;\\n(iii) the act was done in the heat of passion; and that\\n(iv) the assailant had not taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner.117.'), ('300.33', '\"Fight\": meaning of.—\\nThe \\'ﬁght\\' occurring in Exception 4 to section 300, IPC, 1860 is not deﬁned in IPC, 1860.\\nIt takes two to make a ﬁght. Heat of passion requires that there must be no time for the\\npassions to cool down and in this case, the parties have worked themselves into a fury\\non account of the verbal altercation in the beginning. A ﬁght is a combat between two\\nand more persons whether with or without weapons. It is not possible to enunciate any\\ngeneral rule as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact\\nand whether a quarrel is sudden or not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts\\nof each case.118.\\nThe language of Exception 4 to section 300 is, thus, clear that culpable homicide is not\\nmurder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden ﬁght in the heat of passion\\nupon a sudden quarrel provided the offender has not taken undue advantage or acted\\nin a cruel or unusual manner. In order to bring a case under Exception (4) to section\\n300, IPC, 1860, the evidence must show that the accused without any premeditation\\nand in a heat of passion and without having undue advantage had not acted in cruel\\nmanner. Every one of these circumstances is required to be proved to attract Exception\\n(4) to section 300, IPC, 1860 and it is not suﬃcient to prove only some of them. None\\nof the ingredients have been proved in evidence to bring the case under Exception (4)\\nto section 300, IPC, 1860.119. Case comes under Exception 4 where the prosecution\\nevidence suﬃciently suggested that a scuﬄe had taken place on the dingy where the\\nappellant and his companions were trying to recover the dingy while the deceased was\\npreventing them from doing so, and in the course of this sudden ﬁght and in the heat of\\npassion, the appellant assaulted the deceased and pushed him in the sea eventually\\nresulting in his death.120. Where there was no pre-meditation and the act was\\ncommitted in a heat of passion and the appellant had not taken any undue advantage\\nor acted in a cruel manner and there was a ﬁght between the parties, the Supreme\\nCourt found that the case falls under the fourth exception to section 300, IPC, 1860 and\\nthe conviction altered from section 302, IPC, 1860 to section 304, Part I, IPC, 1860.121.\\nHeat of passion requires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and\\nin this case the parties have worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal\\naltercation in the beginning.122.\\nThis Exception was held not to apply to a case where two bodies of men, for the most\\npart armed with deadly weapons, deliberately entered into an unlawful ﬁght, each being\\nprepared to cause the death of the other, and aware that his own might follow, but\\ndetermined to do his best in self-defence, and in the course of the struggle death\\nensued.123. An unpremeditated assault (in which death is caused) committed in the\\nheat of passion upon a sudden quarrel comes within the Exception.124.\\nException 4 is attracted only when there is a ﬁght or quarrel which requires mutual\\nprovocation and blows by both sides in which the offender does not take undue\\nadvantage.125.\\nA \"sudden ﬁght\" implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. The homicide\\ncommitted is then clearly not traceable to unilateral provocation, nor could in such\\ncases the whole blame be placed on one side. For if it were so, the Exception more\\nappropriately applicable would be Exception 1.126.\\nThe word \\'ﬁght\\' conveys something more than a verbal quarrel.127. It takes two to make\\na ﬁght. It is not necessary that weapons should be used in a ﬁght. In order to constitute\\nﬁght, it is necessary that blows should be exchanged even if they do not all ﬁnd their\\ntarget.128. The ﬁght must be with the person who is killed and not with another\\nperson.129. The words \"undue advantage\" in this Exception means \"unfair\\nadvantage\".130. Where a wordy quarrel had taken place and the quarrel had led to the\\nuse of weapons by both the parties against each other, the Supreme Court said that it\\ncould not be held to be a kind of case in which the accused had deliberately attacked\\nthe deceased with an intention to kill them. It is a case which would fall under the\\nException 4 to section 300, IPC, 1860.131. Where on account of a sudden impulse and\\nwithout any intention or knowledge of the impending consequences, the accused\\nsqueezed the testicles of the other causing shock, cardiac arrest and instant death, the\\nSupreme Court held that the offence in question amounted to grievous hurt punishable\\nunder section 325 and not under this section.132. Where two cultivating parties working\\nin their respective ﬁelds picked up a sudden quarrel over the dividing line and death\\nensued, there was no previous ill-will between them and, therefore, no pre-meditation,\\nconviction was altered from under section 302 to one under section 304, Part I read\\nwith section 34.133. Where, on the other hand, the incident did take place at the spur of\\nthe moment and evidence showed that the accused persons intentionally assaulted the\\ndeceased and his family in a brutal manner, their conviction under section 300 was held\\nto be proper.134. The accused persons cannot argue successfully that the incident\\noccurred at the spur of the moment where they came to the place of occurrence armed\\nwith deadly weapons. In this case, the evidence established that it was a pre-meditated\\nact, thus their conviction for the offence punishable under section 302, IPC, 1860 was\\nheld proper.135. In a sudden ﬁght in heat of passion and without pre-meditation the\\naccused armed with deadly weapon inﬂicted fatal blows on the unarmed deceased\\neven when he fell on the ground. It was held that Exception 4 of section 300 was not\\nattracted and the conviction of the accused for murder was proper.136.\\nWhere the offender took an undue advantage or acted in a cruel and unusual manner, it\\nwas held that the beneﬁt of Exception 4 could not be given to him. The Supreme Court\\nobserved that the weapon used or the manner of attack is out of all proportion, that\\nfact must be taken into consideration for deciding whether undue advantage was\\ntaken.137.\\nA person opened the door on the call of his uncle who was under assault. He was\\nunarmed and came out to see what was happening. He received a gunshot at his chest\\ncausing death. The Court said that the appellant had taken undue advantage of his\\nposition at the time. He could not claim the beneﬁt of Exception 4.138.\\nWhere though there was a sudden quarrel between the accused and the deceased,\\nthere was absolutely no ﬁght between the two as there was no exchange of blows, nor\\nany attack from the side of the deceased who was totally unarmed but nevertheless\\nthe accused attacked the deceased with an axe causing his death, it was held that his\\ncase did not fall either within Exception 4 or Exception 2 and he was squarely liable\\nunder section 302, IPC, 1860.139. A sudden ﬁght developed between the accused and\\nthe deceased while the former was telling the latter that he should not carry his cattle\\nby the side of the ﬁeld of the accused. Three brothers of the accused rushed to his\\nrescue and belaboured the deceased with whatever weapons they had in their hands.\\nThe deceased died of multiple injuries and broken bones. The ferocious cruelty\\nestablished intention to cause death and took the case out of the exception.140.\\nThe accused abused a road sweeper who happened to throw mud on him. The father\\nof the sweeper slapped the accused. The infuriated accused went away and came back\\nwith others. He alone, however, inﬂicted the fatal blow. The occurrence was of sudden\\norigin because the gap between the injury and quarrel was that of only a few minutes.\\nThere was no previous enmity and blows were not repeated as the deceased fell down\\nhelpless. There was no unusual cruelty. The beneﬁt of Exception 4 was allowed.141. In\\na quarrel between the accused and his father, the accused attacked his father with a\\ndagger causing death and also attacked the intervener who were his stepmother and\\nsisters. No injury was caused to the accused because all others were unarmed. The\\naccused took undue advantage of that fact. He acted in a cruel manner. The exception\\nwas not attracted. He was guilty of murder.142. It cannot be said in all cases of a single\\nblow that section 302 would not be attracted. A single blow in some cases may entail\\nconviction under section 302 in some cases or under section 304 and in some cases\\nunder section 326. Acting on this principle in a case where the victim was invited to a\\nparticular place and there three associates of the accused caught hold of him and the\\naccused delivered a single knife blow on the chest, about which it could not be said\\nthat it was not inﬂicted without premeditation, the Court said that it could not be said\\nthat the accused had not taken undue advantage. Exception 4 was not attracted.143.\\nWhere the accused, who had gone along with the deceased and others, picked up a\\nquarrel with the deceased, entered his house, and came back with a knife and gave\\nblows to the deceased and others who tried to stop them and then ran away, it was\\nheld that Exception 4 to section 300 was not applicable. Conviction under section 302\\nwas proper.144. A quarrel took place between a son and his father just outside the son\\'s\\nhouse. The son dragged the father into the Courtyard. His other sons came out to his\\nrescue. The son retreated into the room, bolted it from inside and shot at them from the\\nwindow. One of his brothers received a bullet at his chest and died. The plea of self-\\ndefence was not accepted. His father and brothers were the eye-witnesses who were\\nnaturally there for saving the skin of their father. The accused shot at them from the\\nbolted security of his room.145.\\nA previous quarrel triggered off because of sarcastic remarks made during the\\noccasion of a marriage. Three accused started shooting with their respective guns at\\nunarmed victims from close range on vital parts of their bodies. The victims had merely\\nindulged in verbal duel with them. The accused acted in cruel and unusual manner.\\nConviction for the offence of murder was held to be proper, Exception 4 being not\\napplicable.146.'), ('300.34', \"Comparison of Exception 1 (provocation) with Exception 4 (sudden\\nﬁght).—\\nException 4 of section 300, IPC, 1860 covers acts done in a sudden ﬁght. The said\\nexception deals with a case of prosecution not covered by the ﬁrst exception, after\\nwhich its place would have been more appropriate. The exception is founded upon the\\nsame principle, for in both there is absence of premeditation. But, while in the case of\\nException 1, there is total deprivation of self-control, in the case of Exception 4, there is\\nonly that heat of passion which clouds men's sober reason and urges them to deeds\\nwhich they would not otherwise do. There is provocation in Exception 4 as in Exception\\n1; but the injury done is not the direct consequence of that provocation. In fact,\\nException 4 deals with cases in which notwithstanding that a blow may have been\\nstruck, or some provocation given in the origin of the dispute or in whatever way the\\nquarrel may have originated, yet the subsequent conduct of both parties puts them in\\nrespect of guilt upon equal footing. A 'sudden ﬁght' implies mutual provocation and\\nblows on each side. The homicide committed is then clearly not traceable to unilateral\\nprovocation, nor in such cases could the whole blame be placed on one side. For if it\\nwere so, the Exception more appropriately applicable would be Exception 1. There is no\\nprevious deliberation or determination to ﬁght. A ﬁght suddenly takes place, for which\\nboth parties are more or less to be blamed. It may be that one of them starts it, but if\\nthe other had not aggravated it by his own conduct, it would not have taken the serious\\nturn it did. There is then mutual provocation and aggravation, and it is diﬃcult to\\napportion the share of blame which attaches to each ﬁghter. The help of Exception 4\\ncan be invoked if death is caused (a) without premeditation; (b) in a sudden ﬁght; (c)\\nwithout the offender's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual\\nmanner; and (d) the ﬁght must have been with the person killed. To bring a case within\\nException 4, all the ingredients mentioned in it must be found. It is to be noted that the\\n'ﬁght' occurring in Exception 4 to section 300, IPC, 1860 is not deﬁned in the IPC, 1860.\\nIt takes two to make a ﬁght. Heat of passion requires that there must be no time for the\\npassions to cool down and in this case, the parties have worked themselves into a fury\\non account of the verbal altercation in the beginning. A ﬁght is a combat between two\\nand more persons whether with or without weapons. It is not possible to enunciate any\\ngeneral rule as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact\\nand whether a quarrel is sudden or not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts\\nof each case. For the application of Exception 4, it is not suﬃcient to show that there\\nwas a sudden quarrel and there was no premeditation. It must further be shown that\\nthe offender has not taken undue advantage or acted in cruel or unusual manner. The\\nexpression 'undue advantage' as used in the provision means 'unfair advantage'.147. In\\nboth cases, there is absence of premeditation. But in Exception 1 there is total\\ndeprivation of self-control, in case of Exception there is such heat of passion as clouds\\nsober reason and urges the man to do something which he would not otherwise do. A\\nsudden ﬁght implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. The homicide in such\\na case is not traceable to unilateral provocation. In such cases, the whole blame cannot\\nbe attributed to one side. It may be that a ﬁght was initiated by one side but without\\naggravating provocation from the other side it might not have taken the serious turn.

If the prosecution is\\nsuccessful in providing cogent and satisfactory proof of the victim having met a\\nhomicidal death, absence of corpus delicti will not by itself be fatal to a charge of\\nmurder.157.'), ('300.38', 'Ascertainment of time of death.—\\nJudging the time of death from the contents of the stomach may not always be the\\ndeterminative test. It will require due corroboration from other evidence.158.'), ('300.39', 'Single eye-witness, corroboration needed.—\\nA child witness (aged 13 years at the time of incident) deposed categorically about the\\ngruesome incident he had witnessed. The Supreme Court held that in such situation, it\\nis considered a safe rule of prudence to generally geneally look for corroboration of the\\nsworn testimony of the witness in Court, as to the identity of the accused, who are\\nstrangers to them, in the form of earlier identiﬁcation proceeding.159.'), ('300.40', 'Acquittal of co-accused, effect.—\\nAllegation was that the accused along with the juvenile attacked the deceased. Eye\\nwitness deposed that the juvenile was not involved. Acquittal of the juvenile has no\\neffect on the case of others.160. Beneﬁt of acquittal of co-accused cannot be given to\\nthe main accused.161.'), ('300.41', 'Non-production of FIR book.—\\nThe incident involved assault on villagers and causing of multiple deaths. The injured\\nwitness gave written complaint in the hospital duly signed by him. The complaint was\\nimmediately sent to the police station. On its basis, a printed FIR was registered and a\\ncopy sent to the magistrate. These circumstances completely ruled out the suggestion\\nthat the FIR was bogus or doctored. Non-production of the book was due to non-\\navailability. This cannot by itself, invite suspicious glance from the Court or be a ground\\nfor throwing out the prosecution case.162.'), ('300.42', 'Delay in FIR.—\\nWhether the delay is so long as to draw a cloud of suspicion on the prosecution case\\nwill depend upon a variety of factors, which will vary from case to case.164. Where the\\noccurrence took place in the late night in a remote village and the sufferers of the\\nincident were the widow and her two minor children, apart from the fact that the police\\nstation was one and a half kilometres away, the delay in registering FIR on the next day\\nis proper.165.'), ('300.43', 'Strange behaviour of the complainant.—\\nWhere the incident of murder occurred inside the forest, while some friends of the\\ncomplainant were participating in a party and the informant/eye-witness instead of\\ngoing to the police station went to the house of an Advocate. The Supreme Court found\\nthat it appeared to be a very strange behaviour on the part of the complainant and so\\nmany of his friends who were with him to go to an Advocate, that too 15 kms away,\\nrather than approaching the Police Station to report the matter.166.'), ('300.44', 'Motive.—\\nIt is fairly well settled that while motive does not have a major role to play in cases\\nbased on eye-witness account of the incident, it assumes importance in cases that rest\\nentirely on circumstantial evidence.167. Where other circumstances lead to the only\\nhypothesis that the accused has committed the offence, the Court cannot acquit the\\naccused of the offence merely because the motive for committing the offence has not\\nbeen established in the case.168. If depositions giving the eye-witness account of\\nincident that led to death of deceased are reliable, absence of a motive would make\\nlittle difference.169. When there is an eye-witness account on record, the absence of\\nmotive pales into insigniﬁcance.170.'), ('300.45', \"Last seen together.—\\nIt is trite law that a conviction cannot be recorded against the accused merely on the\\nground that the accused was last seen with the deceased.171. There may however be\\ncases where, on account of close proximity of place and time between the event of the\\naccused having been last seen with the deceased and the factum of death, a rational\\nmind may be persuaded to reach an irresistible conclusion that either the accused\\nshould explain how and in what circumstances the victim suffered the death or should\\nown the liability for the homicide.172. But in Arabindra Mukherjee v State of WB,173.,174.\\nit was held that once the accused was last seen with the deceased, the onus is upon\\nhim to show that either he was not involved in the occurrence at all or that he had left\\nthe deceased at her home or at any other reasonable place.

In C Perumal v Rajasekaran,175.,176. there was\\na time lag of two days in last seen together of A2– A5 with the deceased and Court\\nfound it diﬃcult to connect them with the incident. Where the accused was last seen\\ntogether with the deceased by his wife, but the prosecution could not establish the\\ncause of death, the accused was not convicted based on the last seen theory.177.\\nThe circumstance of last seen together does not by itself and necessarily lead to the\\ninference that it was the accused who committed the crime. There must be something\\nmore establishing the connectivity between the accused and the crime. Mere non-\\nexplanation on the part of the accused by itself, cannot lead to proof of guilt against\\nthe appellant.178. Where it was found that the deceased was in the company of the\\naccused prior to one week of the post-mortem of the deceased and it was also found\\nthrough the post-mortem that the murder was about one week ago, the Court held that\\nthe last seen theory applies.179.\\nWhere there was a clear gap of 51 hours and 45 minutes between the time when the\\nvictim was last seen in the company of the accused and the time of his death, it was\\nheld that this time gap was too wide to act upon the last seen theory.180.\"), ('300.46', 'Plea of alibi.—\\nWhile weighing the plea of \\'alibi\\', the same has to be weighed against the positive\\nevidence led by the prosecution.182.\\n519 [LNIND 2009 SC 58] ; Budhi Lal v State of Uttarakhand, AIR 2009 SC 87 [LNIND 2008 SC\\n1928] : (2008) 14 SCC 647 [LNIND 2008 SC 1928] ; Abdul Waheed Khan Waheed v State of\\nAndhra Pradesh, JT 2002 (6) SC 274 [LNIND 2002 SC 530] ; Augustine Saldanha v State of\\nKarnataka, 2003 (10) SCC 472 [LNIND 2003 SC 709] ; Thangaiya v State of TN, 2005 (9) SCC 650\\n[LNIND 2004 SC 1221] and Sunder Lal v State of Rajasthan, 2007 (10) SCC 371 [LNIND 2007 SC\\n599] .\\n1992 SC 214 [LNIND 1991 SC 301] : 1992 Cr LJ 293 : 1991 Supp (2) SCC 75 , discussing how\\nevidence in criminal cases is to be appreciated.

      "[('301', \"Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose\\ndeath was intended.\\nIf a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death,\\ncommits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he\\nneither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide\\ncommitted by the offender is of the description of which it would have been if he had\\ncaused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to be likely\\nto cause.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nDoctrine of transferred malice.—Section 301 of IPC, 1860 speciﬁes that if a person by\\ndoing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits\\nculpable homicide by causing death of any person whose death he neither intends, nor\\nknows himself to be likely to cause, culpable homicide committed by the offender is of\\nthe description of which it would have been, if he had caused the death of the person,\\nwhose death he intended or knew himself to be likely to cause.183. Blow aimed at the\\nintended victim, if alights on another, offence is the same as it would have been if the\\nblow had struck the intended victim.184. This section lays down that culpable homicide\\nmay be committed by causing the death of a person whom the offender neither\\nintended, nor knew himself to be likely, to kill. This section embodies what the English\\nauthors describe as the doctrine of transfer of malice or the transmigration of motive.\\nUnder this section, if A intends to kill B but kills C whose death he neither intends nor\\nknows himself to be likely to cause, the intention to kill C is, by law attributed to\\nhim.185.\\nIf the killing takes place in the course of doing an act which a person intends or knows\\nto be likely to cause death, it ought to be treated as if the real intention of the killer had\\nbeen actually carried out.\\nWhere a mistake is made in respect of the person, as where the offender shoots at A\\nsupposing that he is shooting at B, it is clear that the difference of person can make\\nnone in the offence or its consequences; the crime consists in the wilful doing of a\\nprohibited act; the act of shooting at A was wilful, although the offender mistook him\\nfor another.\\nWhere the accused was deliberately trying to shoot at a ﬂeeing man who had criticised\\nhis father in a School Committee Meeting but unfortunately his own maternal uncle\\ncame in between him and the intended victim and thus got killed, it was held that the\\nact of the accused was nothing but murder under section 302 read with section 301,\\nIPC, 1860.186. In an altercation between parties, the accused persons ﬁred\\nindiscriminately upon the ﬂeeing party, one shot hit a person and second caused the\\ndeath of the complainant's 10-year-old son. The episode took place in a commercial\\nlocality. The death was held to be intentional murder punishable under sections\\n300/301.187. The accused reached his intended victim's house. The latter hid himself\\nsomewhere else. The accused chased him there and standing before that house ﬁred\\ninto it. The housewife became prey and fell dead. It was held that under the doctrine of\\ntransfer of malice, the accused must be convicted under sections 302 and 307 and\\nsentenced to life imprisonment.188. Where the accused intended to kill a particular\\nperson by his lorry but another person chanced to come before the lorry and happened\\nto be killed, an offence under this section was committed and the accused was\\nconvicted under section 302.189.\\nSimilarly, there will be no difference where the injury intended for one falls on another\\nby accident. If A makes a thrust at B, meaning to kill, and C throwing himself between,\\nreceives the thrust and dies, A will answer for it as if his mortal purpose had taken\\nplace on B.\\nThe same principle is applicable where, through accident or the mistake of a party not\\nprivy to the criminal design, the mischief falls either on a person not intended, or on the\\nparty intended but in a different manner from that intended.190. Accused had entered\\nthe house of witness to kill him but due to non-availability of electricity and under the\\nwrong impression he killed the deceased. Death of deceased can be said to be\\naccidental due to mistaken identity rather than any intentional act of accused. Order of\\nconviction of accused under section 302, IPC, 1860 is modiﬁed to one under section\\n304, Part II, IPC, 1860.191.\\nIn a scuﬄe between accused persons and the complainant's party, one member on the\\naccused's side ﬁred a shot at a particular member on the complainant's side but the\\nshot actually hit another person who died. The Court held that the doctrine of\\ntransferred malice was attracted. The act of the accused would be covered by section\\n304 and he was liable to be convicted under Part II of that section, though the\\ndeceased was neither aimed at nor intended to be harmed by the accused.192.\\nIt is not a disputed fact as to whose ﬁre shot resulted in the death of the deceased. The\\nonly question which is to be examined here is whether the offence committed by the\\nrespondent is culpable homicide amounting to murder, punishable under section 302 or\\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder, punishable under section 304, Part I. Here,\\nthe intention on the part of the respondent-accused in causing bodily injury as is likely\\nto cause death is also not a disputed fact.

It stipulates a punishment of death or\\nimprisonment for life and ﬁne. Once an offender is found by the Court to be guilty of\\nthe offence of murder under section 302, then it has to sentence the offender to either\\ndeath or for imprisonment for life. The Court has no power to impose any lesser\\nsentence.'), ('302.1', 'Punishment for murder.—Evolution.—\\nCr PC, 1898 had section 376(5) which required that if an accused is convicted of an\\noffence punishable with death and the Court sentences him with any punishment other\\nthan death, the Court shall, in its judgment, give reasons why death sentence was not\\npassed. The provision of section 367(5) of the 1898 Code reads as follows:\\n(5) If the accused is convicted of an offence punishable with death, and the Court\\nsentences him to any punishment other than death, the Court shall in its judgment state\\nthe reason why sentence of death was not passed.\\nIn 1955, Cr PC (Amendment) Act, 1955 deleted the aforesaid section 367(5) of the\\n1898 Code. As a result of this amendment, which came into effect from 1 January\\n1956, it was no longer necessary for a Court to record in its judgment, in case of\\nconviction in connection with an offence punishable with death, any reason for not\\nimposing the death sentence. Thus, in the new Code, the discretion of the judge to\\nimpose death sentence has been narrowed, for the Court has to provide special\\nreasons for imposing a sentence of death. It has made imprisonment for life the rule\\nand death sentence an exception, in the matter of awarding punishment for murder.197.\\nReference to extenuating or mitigating circumstances in a case of death penalty was\\nmade possibly for the ﬁrst time by Supreme Court in the case of Nawab Singh v State of\\nUP.198. The Court held that in the facts of that case, murder was a cruel and deliberate\\none and there were no extenuating circumstances. After the amendment of 1898 Code,\\nin the year 1955, the ﬁrst case relating to death sentence, which came before Supreme\\nCourt was that of Vadivelu Thevar v State of Madras,199. in which it was held that the\\nquestion of sentence has to be determined, not with reference to the volume or\\ncharacter of the evidence adduced by the prosecution in support of the prosecution\\ncase, but with reference to the fact whether there are any extenuating circumstances\\nwhich can be said to mitigate the enormity of the crime. If the Court is satisﬁed that\\nthere are such mitigating circumstances, only then, it would be justiﬁed in imposing the\\nlesser of the two sentences provided by law.'), ('302.2', 'Constitutionality of Death penalty.—\\nThe constitutionality of death sentence was challenged in the case of Jagmohan Singh\\nv State of UP.200. The Constitution Bench while upholding the constitutionality of death\\npenalty examined whether total discretion can be conferred on the judges in awarding\\ndeath sentence, when the statute does not provide any guidelines on how to exercise\\nthe same. The decision in Jagmohan Singh (supra) was rendered when Cr PC, 1973\\nwas not in existence. However, the aforesaid position substantially changed with the\\nintroduction of a changed sentencing structure under Cr PC, 1973. In Rajendra Prasad v\\nState of UP,201. it was held that the special reasons necessary for imposing a death\\npenalty must relate not to the crime but to the criminal. It could be awarded only if the\\nsecurity of the state and society, public order in the interest of the general public\\ncompelled that course.\\nProposition laid down by the Constitution Bench in Jagmohan Singh\\'s Case\\n(i) The general legislative policy that underlines the structure of our criminal law,\\nprincipally contained in the IPC, 1860 and Cr PC, 1973, is to deﬁne an offence\\nwith suﬃcient clarity and to prescribe only the maximum punishment therefore,\\nand to allow a very wide discretion to the Judge in the matter of ﬁxing the degree\\nof punishment.\\nWith the solitary exception of section 303, the same policy permeates section\\n302 and some other sections of IPC, 1860, where the maximum punishment is\\nthe death penalty.\\n(ii) (a) No exhaustive enumeration of aggravating or mitigating circumstances which\\nshould be considered when sentencing an offender, is possible. \"The inﬁnite\\nvariety of cases and facets to each case would make general standards\\neither meaningless \\'boiler plate\\' or a statement of the obvious that no Jury\\n(Judge) would need.\" (referred to McGoutha v California.202.\\n(b) The impossibility of laying down standards is at the very core of the\\ncriminal law as administered in India which invests the Judges with a\\nvery wide discretion in the matter of ﬁxing the degree of punishment.\\n(iii) The view taken by the plurality in Furman v Georgia,203. decided by the Supreme\\nCourt of the United States, to the effect, that a law which gives uncontrolled and\\nunguided discretion to the Jury (or the Judge) to choose arbitrarily between a\\nsentence of death and imprisonment for a capital offence, violates the Eighth\\nAmendment, is not applicable in India. We do not have in our Constitution any\\nprovision like the Eighth Amendment, nor are we at liberty to apply the test of\\nreasonableness with the freedom with which the Judges of the Supreme Court\\nof America are accustomed to apply \"the due process\" clause. There are grave\\ndoubts about the expediency of transplanting western experience in our\\ncountry. Social conditions are different and so also the general intellectual level.\\nArguments which would be valid in respect of one area of the world may not\\nhold good in respect of another area.\\n(iv) (a) This discretion in the matter of sentence is to be exercised by the Judge\\njudicially, after balancing all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of\\nthe crime.\\n(b) The discretion is liable to be corrected by Superior Courts. The\\nexercise of judicial discretion on well-recognised principles is, in the\\nﬁnal analysis, the safest possible safeguard for the accused. In view\\nof the above, it will be impossible to say that there would be at all any\\ndiscrimination, since crime as crime may appear to be superﬁcially\\nthe same, but the facts and circumstances of a crime are widely\\ndifferent. Thus considered, the provision in section 302, IPC, 1860 is\\nnot violative of Article 14 of the Constitution on the ground that it\\nconfers on the Judges an unguided and uncontrolled discretion in the\\nmatter of awarding capital punishment or imprisonment for life.\\n(v) (a) Relevant facts and circumstances impinging on the nature and\\ncircumstances of the crime can be brought before the Court at the\\npreconviction stage, notwithstanding the fact that no formal procedure for\\nproducing evidence regarding such facts and circumstances had been\\nspeciﬁcally provided. Where counsel addresses the Court with regard to the\\ncharacter and standing of the accused, they are duly considered by the Court\\nunless there is something in the evidence itself which belies him or the Public\\nProsecutor challenges the facts.\\n(b) It is to be emphasised that in exercising its discretion to choose either\\nof the two alternative sentences provided in section 302, IPC, 1860:\\nthe Court is principally concerned with the facts and circumstances\\nwhether aggravating or mitigating, which are connected with the\\nparticular crime under inquiry. All such facts and circumstances are\\ncapable of being proved in accordance with the provisions of the\\nIndian Evidence Act in a trial regulated by the CrPC. The trial does not\\ncome to an end until all the relevant facts are proved and the counsel\\non both sides have an opportunity to address the Court. The only thing\\nthat remains is for the Judge to decide on the guilt and punishment\\nand that is whats. 306(2) and s. 309(2), CrPC purport to provide for.\\nThese provisions are part of the procedure established by law and\\nunless it is shown that they are invalid for any other reasons they must\\nbe regarded as valid. No reasons are offered to show that they are\\nconstitutionally invalid and hence the death sentence imposed after\\ntrial in accordance with the procedure established by law is not\\nunconstitutional under Art. 21.\\n[Jagmohan Singh v State of UP.]204.'), ('302.3', 'Evolution of Sentencing Policy\\nCapital punishment has been a subject matter of great social and judicial discussion\\nand catechism. From whatever point of view it is examined, one undisputable\\nstatement of law follows that it is neither possible nor prudent to state any universal\\nformula which would be applicable to all the cases of criminology where capital\\npunishment has been prescribed. It shall always depend upon the facts and\\ncircumstances of a given case.205.'), ('302.4', 'Phase-I (Focus on Crime).—\\nJagmohan Singh\\'s Case (supra) laid down that discretion in the matter of sentencing is\\nto be exercised by the judge after balancing all the aggravating and mitigating\\ncircumstances \"of the crime\". Jagmohan Singh also laid down in proposition that while\\nchoosing between the two alternative sentences provided in section 302 of IPC, 1860\\n(sentence of death and sentence of life imprisonment), the Court is principally\\nconcerned with the aggravating or mitigating circumstances connected with the\\n\"particular crime under inquiry\".'), ('302.5', 'Legislative Change.—\\nThe 41st Law Commission Report proposed extensive changes in the 1898 Code. In\\nparagraph 23.2 of the said report, the Law Commission recommended a set of new\\nprovisions for governing \"trials before a Court of sessions\". With regard tosection 309\\nof the 1898 Code, the Law Commission recommended that hearing of the accused was\\nmost desirable before passing any sentence against him. This recommendation was\\naccepted and incorporated while enacting section 235, Cr PC in 1973 Code within\\nChapter XVIII of the same under the heading \"Trial before a Court of Sessions\". The\\nmost signiﬁcant change brought about by the incorporation of the recommendation of\\nthe Law Commission, is the giving of an opportunity of hearing to the accused on the\\nquestion of sentence. This opportunity of hearing at the post-conviction stage gives the\\naccused an opportunity to raise fundamental issues for adjudication and effective\\ndetermination by Court of its sentencing discretion in a fair and reasonable manner. In\\nSanta Singh v State of Punjab,206. the Supreme Court held that this provision is in\\nconsonance with the modern trends in penology and sentencing procedures. It was\\nfurther held that proper exercise of sentencing discretion calls for consideration of\\nvarious factors like the nature of offence, the circumstances—both extenuating or\\naggravating, the prior criminal record, if any, of the offender, the age of the offender, his\\nbackground, his education, his personal life, his social adjustment, the emotional and\\nmental condition of the offender, the prospects for the rehabilitation of the offender, the\\npossibility of his rehabilitation in the life of community, the possibility of treatment or\\ntraining of the offender, the possibility that the sentence may serve as a deterrent to\\ncrime by the offender or by others.'), ('302.6', 'Phase-II Doctrine of \"Rarest of rare\" (Shifting the focus from crime to\\ncriminal).—\\nIn Bachan Singh v State of Punjab,207. another Constitution Bench, while upholding the\\nconstitutional validity of death sentence observed that for persons convicted of\\nmurder, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception. The principal\\nquestions considered in this case were:\\n(i) Whether death penalty provided for the offence of murder in Section 302, Penal Code is\\nunconstitutional.\\n(ii) If the answer to the foregoing question be in the negative, whether the sentencing\\nprocedure provided in Section 354(3) of the CrPC, 1973 (Act 2 of 1974) is unconstitutional\\non the ground that it invests the Court with unguided and untrammelled discretion and\\nallows death sentence to be arbitrarily or freakishly imposed on a person found guilty of\\nmurder or any other capital offence punishable under the Indian Penal Code with death or, in\\nthe alternative, with imprisonment for life.\\nThe conclusion of the Constitution Bench was that the sentence of death ought to be\\ngiven only in the \\'rarest of rare cases\\' [See the Box with \\'Supreme Court Guidelines in\\nBachan Singh\\'] and it should be given only when the option of awarding the sentence of\\nlife imprisonment is \"unquestionably foreclosed\". It laid down the framework law on\\nthis point. Bachan Singh effectively opened up Phase II of a sentencing policy by\\nshifting the focus from the crime to the crime and the criminal.\\nSupreme Court Guidelines in Bachan Singh\\n(i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inﬂicted except in gravest cases of\\nextreme culpability;\\n(ii) Before opting for the death penalty, the circumstances of the \\'offender\\' also\\nrequire to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the\\n\\'crime\\';\\n(iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. In other\\nwords, death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears\\nto be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant\\ncircumstances of the crime, and only provided, the option to impose sentence\\nof imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to\\nthe nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances;\\n(iv) A balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn\\nup and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full\\nweightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the\\nmitigating circumstances before the option is exercised.\\n[Bachan Singh v State of Punjab.208.]\\nThe judgment in Machhi Singh v State of Rajasthan,209. did not only state the above\\nguidelines in some elaboration, but also speciﬁed the mitigating circumstances which\\ncould be considered by the Court while determining such serious issues.210. Despite\\nthe legislative change and Bachan Singh discarding proposition (iv)(a) of Jagmohan\\nSingh, Supreme Court in Machhi Singh revived the \"balancing\" of aggravating and\\nmitigating circumstances through a balance sheet theory. In doing so, it sought to\\ncompare aggravating circumstances pertaining to a crime with the mitigating\\ncircumstances pertaining to a criminal. It hardly need be stated, with respect, that\\nthese are completely distinct and different elements and cannot be compared with one\\nanother. A balance sheet cannot be drawn up of two distinct and different constituents\\nof an incident. Nevertheless, the balance sheet theory held the ﬁeld post Machhi\\nSingh.211.\\nSupreme Court Guidelines in Machhi Singh\\nFactors to be considered while determining the \"rarest of rare\" case\\nI.

Abduction for ransom and gang\\nrape and murders committed in course of those offences were yet to become a\\nmenace for the society compelling the legislature to create special slots for those\\noffences in IPC, 1860. At the time of Machhi Singh, Delhi had not witnessed the\\ninfamous Sikh carnage. There had been no attack on the country\\'s Parliament. There\\nwere no bombs planted by terrorists killing completely innocent people, men, women\\nand children in dozens with sickening frequency. There were no private armies, no\\nmaﬁa cornering huge Government contracts purely by muscle power, no reports of\\nkillings of social activists and \"whistle-blowers\", no reports of custodial deaths and\\nrape and fake encounters by police or even by armed forces. These developments\\nwould unquestionably ﬁnd a more pronounced reﬂection in any classiﬁcation if one\\nwere to be made today.

Where there was nothing to show that the\\nappellant-accused could not be reformed and rehabilitated, the mere manner of\\ndisposal of the dead body, howsoever abhorrent, should not by itself be regarded\\nsuﬃcient to bring the case in the rarest of rare category. In the present case, all the\\naccused including the appellant were unemployed young men in search of job. They\\nwere not criminals. In exception of a plan proposed by the appellant and accepted by\\nthem, they kidnapped a friend of theirs with the motive of procuring ransom from his\\nfamily but later murdered him, and after cutting his body into pieces, disposed of the\\nsame at different places. One of the accuseds turned approver and prosecution case\\nwas based exclusively on his evidence. Appellant-accused contradicted the approver\\'s\\nversion in respect of his role. In such a case, statement of approver regarding manner\\nof murder and role of accused and that of approver himself, should be tested on the\\nbasis of prudence doctrine taking into consideration inter alia, evidence produced by\\nthe accused for imposition of lesser punishment. Hence, death penalty awarded by the\\nCourts below, in the absence of any special reasons to support the same was\\nsubstituted by penalty of rigorous imprisonment for life.\\nDeath punishment stands on a very different footing from other types of punishments.\\nIt is unique in its total irrevocability. Incarceration, life or otherwise, potentially serves\\nmore than one sentencing aims. Deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation and\\nretribution all ends are capable to be furthered in different degrees, by calibrating this\\npunishment in light of the overarching penal policy. But the same does not hold true of\\ndeath penalty.294.\\nOne has to observe the global move away from the death penalty. Latest statistics\\nshow that 138 nations have abolished death penalty in either law or practice (no\\nexecutions for 10 years).\\nFurther, on 18 December 2007, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 62/149\\ncalling upon countries that retain death penalty to establish a worldwide moratorium on\\nexecutions with a view to abolishing the death penalty. India is, however, one of the 59\\nnations that retain the death penalty.295.\\nThe Law Commission of India in its Report No. 262 titled \"The Death Penalty\" has\\nrecommended the abolition of death penalty for all the crimes other than terrorism\\nrelated offences and waging war (offences affecting National Security).\\nWhere the question of whether death penalty could be imposed in a case which\\ndepended upon circumstantial evidence, the Supreme Court said:\\nIf the circumstantial evidence is found to be of unimpeachable character in\\nestablishing the guilt of the accused, that form the foundation for conviction and that\\nhas nothing to do with the question of sentence. Mitigating circumstances and the\\naggravating circumstances have to be balanced and in the balance sheet of such\\ncircumstances. The fact that the case rests on circumstantial evidence has no role to\\nplay. In fact, in most of the cases where death sentences are awarded for rape and\\nmurder and the like, there is practically no scope for getting an eyewitness. Such\\noffences are not committed in public view. Only available evidence in such cases is\\ncircumstantial. If such evidence is found to be credible, cogent and trustworthy for the\\npurpose of recording conviction, to treat such evidence as a mitigating circumstance,\\nwould amount to consideration of an irrelevant aspect. Hence, such plea is\\nunsustainable. Instant case fell in category of the rarest of rare cases. Circumstances\\nproved established the depraved acts of the accused, and they called for only one\\nsentence, that is, death sentence.

In view of\\nsection 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872, there will be a corresponding burden on the\\ninmates of the house to give cogent explanation as to how the crime was committed.\\nWhen the deceased is shown to be abducted, it is for the abductors to explain how they\\ndealt with the abducted victim.

In this case,\\nthe prosecution failed to produce the CCTV footages available at the hotel where the\\nmurder took place, the Court further observed that the CCTV footage being a crucial\\npiece of evidence, it is for the prosecution to have produced the best evidence, which\\nwas missing.310.\\nIn the absence of any persuasive evidence to hold that at the relevant time the\\nappellant was present in the house, it would also be impermissible to cast any burden\\non him as contemplated under section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872.311.'), ('302.21', 'Expert opinion.—\\nMerely because no expert opinion was obtained to prove as to whether bones\\nrecovered were human or animal bones, it would not weaken the case of prosecution in\\nthe light of the overwhelming evidence available on record to prove the complicity of\\nthe appellants.312.'), ('302.22', 'Circumstantial evidence.—\\nThe circumstance (that the accused persons were seen in the vicinity of the\\nneighbourhood of the crime little before the same was committed), if coupled with the\\nrecovery of the ornaments of the deceased from the possession of the accused, at\\nbest, create a highly suspicious situation; but beyond a strong suspicion nothing else\\nwould follow in the absence of any other circumstance(s) which could suggest the\\ninvolvement of the accused in the offence/offences alleged.

Section 304, Part II comes into play\\nwhen the death is caused by doing an act with knowledge that it is likely to cause death\\nbut there is no intention on the part of the accused either to cause death or to cause\\nsuch bodily injury as is likely to cause death.325.\"), ('304.3', \"Section 302 or section 304.—Judicial dilemma.—\\nThe Indian Penal Code was enacted in the year 1860 under which the offences within\\nthe territory of India have been tried ever since it was enacted dealing with countless\\nnumber of cases leading either to acquittal or conviction. Yet, the task of the decision-\\nmaking authorities/Courts of whether an offence of culpable homicide is murder or\\nculpable homicide does not amount to murder in the prevailing facts and\\ncircumstances of the case is a perennial question with which the Courts are often\\nconfronted. When the evidence discloses a clear case of murder or makes out a ﬁnding\\nof culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the task of the Courts to record\\nconviction or acquittal is generally an easy one. But this task surely becomes an\\nundaunted one when the accused commits culpable homicide/murder but the\\ncircumstances disclose many a times that it is done without premeditation or pre-\\nplanning, may be to cause grievous hurt, yet it is so grave in nature that it results into\\ndeath and the role of the factum causing death without premeditation becomes a\\nsecondary consideration due to which the decision of the Courts in such cases often\\nhinges on discretion while considering whether the case would fall under section 302,\\nIPC, 1860 or it would be under section 304, Part I or even Part II, IPC, 1860. On a plain\\nreading of section 299, section 300, section 302 and section 304 of IPC, 1860, it\\nappears that given cases can be conveniently classiﬁed into two categories, viz.,\\nculpable homicide amounting to murder which is section 302, IPC, 1860 or culpable\\nhomicide not amounting to murder which is section 304 IPC, 1860. But when it comes\\nto the actual application of these two sections in a given case, the Courts are often\\nconfronted with a dilemma as to whether a case would fall under section 302, IPC,\\n1860 or would fall under section 304, IPC, 1860. Many a time, this gives rise to\\nconﬂicting decisions of one Court or the other giving rise to the popular perception\\namong litigants and members of the Bar that a particular Court is an acquitting Court\\nor is a convicting one. This confusion or dilemma often emerges in a case when the\\nquestion for consideration is whether a given case would fall under section 302, IPC,\\n1860 or section 304, IPC, 1860 when it is diﬃcult to decipher from the evidence\\nwhether the intention was to cause merely bodily injury which would not make out an\\noffence of murder or there was clear intention to kill the victim making out a clear case\\nof an offence of murder.326. Section 300 states both, what is murder and what is not.\\nFirst ﬁnds place in section 300 in its four stated categories, while the second ﬁnds\\ndetailed mention in the stated ﬁve exceptions to section 300. The legislature in its\\nwisdom, thus, covered the entire gamut of culpable homicide that 'amounting to\\nmurder' as well as that 'not amounting to murder' in a composite manner in section 300\\nof the Code. It is neither advisable nor possible to state any straightjacket formula that\\nwould be universally applicable to all cases for such determination. Every case\\nessentially must be decided on its own merits. The Court has to perform the very\\ndelicate function of applying the provisions of the Code to the facts of the case with a\\nclear demarcation as to under what category of cases, the case at hand falls and\\naccordingly punish the accused.327. It has been held that unless the case falls under\\none of the speciﬁed exception in section 300, it cannot be brought under Part I or Part II\\nof section 304 of IPC, 1860.328.\"), ('304.4', \"CASES.—\\nWhere the accused husband suspecting the ﬁdelity of his wife quarrelled with her,\\npoured kerosene on her body and set her on ﬁre and subsequently, when she screamed\\nfor help, tried to extinguish ﬁre by pouring water, the Supreme Court held that he was\\nhaving full knowledge that his act would cause her death and the attempt of\\nextinguishing the ﬁre will not mitigate the offence, hence he was liable under section\\n302, IPC, 1860 and not under section 304, IPC, 1860.329. The accused followed his\\ndaughter into the women's public toilet of the village and assaulted her. The fatal\\ninjuries resulted in her instant death. None of the exceptions in section 300 of IPC,\\n1860 was attracted. It would necessarily follow that the accused committed murder of\\nhis daughter. He was liable to be punished with either imprisonment for life or death\\nunder section 302, IPC, 1860 alone.330. The accused killed his stepfather, who was an\\ninﬁrm old man and an invalid, with the latter's consent, his motive being to get three\\ninnocent men (his enemies) hanged. It was held that the offence was covered by\\nException 5 to section 300 and was punishable under the ﬁrst Part of this section.331.\\nWhere the deceased, an old man with an enlarged and ﬂabby heart, was lifted by the\\naccused during a quarrel and thrown on the ground from some distance with suﬃcient\\nforce and the deceased got his ribs fractured and died of a rupture of the heart, it was\\nheld that the offence fell under section 325 and not under Part II of this section, as the\\naccused had no intention or knowledge to cause death.332. Accused stabbed the\\ndeceased in a sudden incident during an election fever which resulted in his death four\\ndays later in hospital where he had been operated upon in a bid to save his life. There\\nwas no evidence that the accused intended to cause death or cause such bodily injury\\nas was suﬃcient in ordinary course of nature to cause death. In the circumstances, it\\nwas held that the case fell within clause (b) of section 299 but did not fall within clause\\n3 of section 300, IPC, 1860, and as such his conviction under section 302 was set aside\\nand he was convicted under section 304, Part I of the Code.333. Similarly, where a\\nyoung lad of 18½ years old gave only one kassi blow to the deceased following an\\naltercation between his father and the deceased, which resulted in latter's death six\\ndays after, it could not be said that he had intended to cause an injury which was\\nsuﬃcient in ordinary course of nature to cause death within the meaning of clause 3 of\\nsection 300, IPC, 1860. He could be at best saddled with knowledge that his act might\\nresult in death. His conviction was, therefore, changed from section 302 to section 304,\\nPart II, IPC, 1860.334. Accused, in a sudden quarrel gave a blow on the head of his\\nfriend with a stick weighing only 210 grams which caused his death. It was held that\\nhis conviction under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860, was improper as it could not be said\\nthat he had knowledge that such a blow would cause death. His conviction was,\\ntherefore, changed to one under section 323, IPC, 1860.335. In a dispute regarding the\\nright of way, the accused gave a single ﬁst blow on the head of the deceased which\\nresulted into his death. No weapon was used, nor was there any past enmity between\\nthem. The accused was not held to be responsible for the death of the deceased and\\nwas sentenced under section 323, IPC, 1860.336. Where a man lifted a four-year-old\\nchild and threw him on the ground and thus caused his death, it was held that\\nknowledge of death under section 299, IPC, 1860, could be safely attributed to him and\\nhe was therefore liable under section 304, Part-II, IPC, 1860.337. In a sudden quarrel, the\\naccused, a young man, administered a single knife blow on the chest of the deceased\\ncausing his death, it was held that the case did not fall under clauses 1 and 2 of section\\n300 but since he had knowledge that death might follow, he was guilty under section\\n304, Part II, IPC, 1860.338. A police oﬃcer was punished under Part II of this section\\nwith seven-year RI for causing death in custody by resorting to third-degree\\nmethods.339. A woman deserted her husband and started living with her paramour six\\nmonths before the incident. Her ﬁsherman husband, on way back from his work,\\nspotted her sitting among women at outside of a neighbouring house. He approached\\ntowards her. On seeing him, she ran inside. He chased and stabbed her to death. His\\nconviction under Part II and sentence of ﬁve-year rigorous imprisonment was held to be\\nnot excessive.340. A group of persons called out the deceased from his home with a\\nview to lodging a protest but suddenly one of them inﬂicted a knife wound which falling\\non the chest killed the deceased. The Supreme Court convicted the single wound-\\ncausing accused under this section saying that the heat of passion generated at the\\nspur of the moment and not any intention to cause death was responsible for the\\nincident.341. In another case of the same kind before the Supreme Court, the ﬁnding\\nwas that the wrestler-accused had an altercation with the deceased two or three days\\nbefore the incident. The prosecution showed that the accused came to the house of\\nthe deceased, but suppressed further knowledge about the incident. Drops of blood in\\nthe house showed that the deceased was injured there, ran out and fell dead. There\\nwas only one major injury. Conviction under Part I of this section was considered to be\\nappropriate.342. Annoyance was caused by the deceased singing a vulgar song. Quarrel\\nand beating in consequence continued for some time. Accused started beating the\\ndeceased with a stick not thick enough to cause rupture of the spleen. He might not\\nhave had the intention to cause death but had knowledge that death might result. His\\nconviction under section 300 (second) was converted into one under section 304, Part\\nII.343. Where the victim was dragged for about 120 feet and then struck with a crowbar\\nnot using much force, the accused knowing that the assault might cause death but not\\nintending it. Part II was held to be attracted and not Part I.344. A person reaching home\\nin a drunken state started beating his wife. Their son intervened and the accused\\nhurled stones on him twice. The boy succumbed to the head injury then and there.\\nConviction was shifted from under section 302 to 304, Part II, knowledge that death\\nmight be caused.345.\\nPersons exceeding the right of private defence are punished under section 304, Part I\\nand not under section 302.346. Where the deceased died due to the negligent ﬁring by a\\nperson, who came for celebrating a marriage function with a gun, it was held that\\nthough it is not possible to attribute intention, it is equally not possible to hold that the\\nact was done without the knowledge that it is likely to cause death. Everybody, who\\ncarries a gun with live cartridges and even others know that ﬁring a gun and that too in\\nthe presence of several people is an act, which is likely to cause death. Hence, the\\nliability under section 304, Part II. The appellant caused the death of his wife by beating\\nher with a wooden stick. No intention to cause death was proved. He was convicted\\nunder section 304, Part II.347.\\nWhere the death of a player was caused by blowing a cricket stump on him in a friendly\\ncricket match and it was found that the accused player did not know that his act would\\ncause an injury which would cause death or which was likely to cause death, it was\\nheld that a conviction under section 304, Part II was not proper, but that an offence\\nunder section 325 was made out as the injury was caused by a stump which is a blunt\\nweapon.348.\\nA married woman (25 years) met a sudden death in her matrimonial home. Her letters\\nand complaints spoke of harassment. The medical report put the cause of death as\\nrupture of spleen and pancreas caused by external pressure. Her husband, who was\\nattempting to escape by resorting to the theory of death by poisoning, was found guilty\\nand his conviction under Part II of this section and sentence of ﬁve years of RI was\\nupheld by the Supreme Court. Though he might not have intended to cause death, he\\ndid cause an injury about which he must have known that it might cause death.349.\\nWhere one of the accused came forward and delivered a blow on the head of a man\\nwhich proved fatal, the Apex Court was of the view that his act did not attract clause (1)\\nor (3) of section 300 because the accused was armed with no deadly weapon and the\\nhead injury was caused by a farmer with an agricultural instrument which he happened\\nto carry with him. Conviction of the accused causing head injury under section 300 was\\naltered to one under section 304, Part II.350. Several persons surrounded a man. Firstly,\\nhe was pushed down on the ground and then two injuries were caused to him one each\\nby two assailants one of whom was acquitted. Opinion of the doctor was that the\\nvictim died due to shock and haemorrhage resulting from both the injuries. The one\\ninjury alone caused by the accused was not individually suﬃcient to cause death. His\\nconviction was altered from section 300 to that under section 304, Part II.351. Where\\nthe accused inﬂicted a single knife wound in the abdomen of a man which proved fatal\\nand the opinion of the doctor was that, but for complications, the injury was not\\nsuﬃcient to cause death, it was held that the offence did not attract clause (3) of\\nsection 300. He was convicted under section 304, Part II.352. A husband, without any\\nhistory of ill-feeling with his wife, attacked her with the blunt side of an axe and caused\\na head injury after she fell down of which she died, his conviction under Part I of this\\nsection was held to be proper.353. Where a person killed his wife under grave and\\nsudden provocation, a lenient punishment of two years' imprisonment was awarded to\\nhim taking into consideration the welfare of his children.354. Where the accused\\ndelivered a single stab blow on the chest of his wife out of sheer frustration,\\nmomentary impulse and anger, on her refusal to oblige him with sex without any\\nintention to cause her death, his act was held to be culpable homicide not amounting to\\nmurder and his conviction was altered from section 302 to section 304, Part I.355.\\nA pregnant woman went to draw water from a well but she was stopped from doing so\\nby several persons armed with 'lathis' and started abusing her and one of them dealt a\\n'lathi' blow on her head and another kicked her abdomen, as a result she died on the\\nspot and her son who tried to rescue her was also injured. Looking at the conduct of\\nthe accused, it could not be said that they had common object to kill the woman or\\ncause injury to her son. Both the assailants were convicted under section 304, Part II\\nand others were acquitted.356.\\nThe death of a young boy was caused in a brutal and cruel manner. The trial Court\\nconvicted under sections 302/304. The High Court converted it to section 304 without\\nspecifying whether the case fell within Part I or II. Sentence of seven years'\\nimprisonment was imposed. The Supreme Court did not interfere.357.\"), ('304.5', \"CASES under Part I.—\\nWhere the accused with the intention of obstructing the marriage of his sister with the\\ndeceased, gave only one blow which proved fatal and the accused did not repeat the\\nblow though there was nothing to stop him, conviction and sentence of the accused\\nunder section 302 was altered to one under section 304, Part I.358. Where the accused\\nunder misapprehension that the deceased came to abduct his daughter attacked the\\ndeceased with a sharp-edged weapon, without pre-meditation, causing only one injury\\nand he died after three days, conviction of the accused was altered from under section\\n300 to one under section 304, Part I.359. Where three accused persons assaulted the\\ndeceased, one of the accused gave the fatal blow on the victim's head, the second\\naccused caused simple injuries on the knee and arm with spear, and the third gave\\nsimple blows, it was held that the ﬁrst accused was liable to be convicted under\\nsection 304, Part I, and as section 34 was not applicable, the second was convicted\\nunder section 324 and the conviction of the third accused under section 323 was\\nupheld.360.\\nWhere most of the injuries found on the body of the deceased were external and on\\nlower legs and on arms, it was held that intention of the accused was to cause grievous\\nhurt and not murder. Conviction of the accused was altered from sections 304/34, Part\\nI to sections 325/34.361.\"), ('304.6', 'Single blow.—\\nWhere a solitary blow was given with a small wooden yoke on the head of the\\ndeceased, conviction under section 300 was altered to one under section 304, Part\\nI.370.'), ('304.7', 'Death after discharging from the hospital.—\\nThe victim received gunshot injury on head. On the condition of the victim becoming\\nbetter, he was discharged from the hospital. After two months of the incident, he died\\ndue to septicaemia. It was held that having regard to the fact that the victim survived\\nfor 62 days and that his condition was stable when he was discharged from the\\nhospital, the Court cannot draw an inference that the intended injury caused was\\nsuﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death so as to attract clause (3) of\\nsection 300 of IPC, 1860. But as the accused used ﬁrearms and ﬁred at the victim on\\nhis head and he had the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause\\ndeath, the conviction was altered to section 304, Part I.372.'), ('304.8', 'Suicide pact.—\\nThe death of the deceased was not premeditated and the act of the accused causing\\ndeath of his wife appeared to be in furtherance of the understanding between them to\\ncommit suicide and the consent of the deceased and the act of the accused falls under\\nException 5 of section 300, IPC, 1860.373.'), ('304.9', 'Civil Disputes.—\\nIn view of the civil disputes between the families, there was a sudden minor verbal\\nexchange bloated into a sudden physical attack.

There was no intention to cause\\ndeath, though the accused had knowledge that the weapon used by him to inﬂict injury\\non the scalp of the deceased might cause death. As there was absence of intention to\\ncause death or to cause such bodily injury as was likely to cause death, the accused\\npersons were held guilty for an offence punishable under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860\\nand not for the offence under section 300, IPC, 1860.374.'), ('304.10', 'Maximum punishment.—\\nThe maximum punishment that is awardable in case of offence under section 304, Part\\nII, IPC, 1860 is 10 years. In a case, the accused persons were Police Personnel whose\\nduty was to act in accordance with law and caused death when the deceased was in\\npolice custody. The accused fudged the General Diary Register of the Police Station to\\nput up their defence and put up a false plea of alibi.

In Ramesh Kumar v State of Chhattisgarh,578. the Supreme Court\\nheld that where the accused by his acts or by a continued course of conduct\\ncreates such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option but\\nto commit suicide, an \"instigation\" may be inferred. In other words, in order to\\nprove that the accused abetted commission of suicide by a person, it has to be\\nestablished that\\n(a) the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words, deeds\\nor wilful omission or conduct which may even be a wilful silence until the\\ndeceased reacted or pushed or forced the deceased by his deeds, words\\nor wilful omission or conduct to make the deceased move forward more\\nquickly in a forward direction, and\\n(b) that the accused had the intention to provoke, urge or encourage the\\ndeceased to commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above.\\nUndoubtedly, presence of mens rea is the necessary concomitant of\\ninstigation.\\nRelevantly, it may be mentioned that there is a marked difference between\\n\"intimidatory\" statement and \"instigatory\" statement. \"Intimidatory\" statements may\\ngive rise to two types of consequences, (a) either the person to whom such statements\\nare made may be frightened and may be on receiving end or he may be angry enough\\nto retaliate, whereas (b) instigatory statements falls within the category of goading,\\nprovoking, etc.579. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or\\nintentionally aiding a person in doing a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the\\naccused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.580.'), ('306.2', 'The scope and ambit of section 107 IPC, 1860 and its co-relation\\nwith section 306 IPC, 1860.—\\nAbetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a\\nperson in doing of a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate\\nor aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.581. The intention and\\ninvolvement of the accused to aid or instigate the commission of suicide is imperative.\\nAny severance or absence of any of this constituents would militate against this\\nindictment. Remoteness of the culpable acts or omissions rooted in the intention of the\\naccused to actualise the suicide would fall short as well of the offence of abetment\\nessential to attract the punitive mandate of section 306, IPC, 1860. Contiguity,\\ncontinuity, culpability and complicity of the indictable acts or omission are the\\nconcomitant indices of abetment. Section 306 IPC, thus criminalises the sustained\\nincitement for suicide.582. In the case of M Mohan v State,583. the Apex Court held that\\nthere should be some live link, or a proximate link between the act of the accused and\\nthe act of committing of suicide. If the live link is missing, it cannot be said that the\\naccused has instigated, or intentionally aided the commission of suicide. Mere threats\\nof involving the family in a false and frivolous cases cannot be tantamount to\\ninstigation.584.\\nWords uttered in a ﬁt of anger or emotion without any intention could not be regarded\\nas an instigation.585. A type of active role which can be described as amounting to\\ninstigation or aiding for doing something is requisite before a person can be said to\\nhave committed the offence under the section.586.'), ('306.3', 'What, if the abetted survives.—\\nThe Supreme Court in Satvir Singh v State of Punjab,587. explained this particular\\nsituation and held that a person can be convicted only when the abetted person\\ncommits suicide. If it ends in an attempt, the abetter cannot be convicted. It is possible\\nto abet the commission of suicide. But nobody would abet a mere attempt to commit\\nsuicide. It is also inconceivable to have abetment of an abetment. Hence, there cannot\\nbe an offence under section 116 read with section 306, IPC, 1860.'), ('306.4', 'Maltreatment of wife.—\\nMere stray instances of quarrel between husband and wife or the evidence that at\\ntimes the appellant used to consume liquor cannot be termed as abetment as deﬁned\\nunder section 107 IPC, 1860.

Where husband maltreating and beating wife for not conceiving and\\nwife committed suicide, husband is liable to be convicted under section 306.589. The\\naccused husband, a drunkard, always ill-treated his wife, beat her and imputed\\nunchastity. The wife in a quarrel set herself ablaze and died. The husband along with\\nothers attempted to stamp out ﬂames. The conviction of the accused for murder was\\nset aside and he was convicted under section 306.590.'), ('306.5', 'Vicious habits like drinking and gambling and beating wife.—\\nThe wife of the accused poured kerosene oil on herself and set herself ablaze. In her\\ndying declaration she said that her husband used to take liquor after borrowing money\\nfrom villagers and beat her after taking liquor. The Court said that this in itself did not\\namount to abetment.591. The statement in the dying declaration was that the husband\\nused to get drunk, beat her and consistently abuse her. He also told her that he did not\\nbother if she lived or died and asked her to die. The Court held that this did not mean\\nthat the accused intended to lead her to commit suicide. The offence of abetment was\\nnot made out.592.'), ('306.6', 'Extra-marital relationship.—\\nExtra-marital relationship as such is not deﬁned in the IPC, 1860. The mere fact that the\\nhusband has developed some intimacy with another, during the subsistence of\\nmarriage and failed to discharge his marital obligations, as such would not amount to\\n\"cruelty\", but it must be of such a nature as is likely to drive the spouse to commit\\nsuicide to fall within the explanation to section 498A, IPC, 1860. Court, on facts, found\\nthat the alleged extra-marital relationship was not of such a nature as to drive the wife\\nto commit suicide.593.\\nIt has been held that the creation of circumstances for the victim to commit suicide\\namounts to abetment. In this case, the deceased husband felt humiliated at the\\nactivities of indulgence of his wife with the accused. The accused openly spoke of his\\nrelationship with the wife of the deceased. The outrageous acts of the accused drove\\nthe deceased to suicide. The accused was held to be guilty of abetting suicide.594.'), ('306.7', 'Failure to appear at arranged marriage, no abetment.—\\nThe accused settled marriage ceremony date with the girl with whom he was in love\\naffair but did not turn up.

It being an independent act of the victim girl, the accused was\\nacquitted.595.'), ('306.8', 'Pressure for repayment of loan.—\\nWhere the accused had lent a certain amount to a lady and he was persistently\\ndemanding repayment from her, which was no offence, the accused did not know that\\nshe had purchased poisonous tablets and might commit suicide, he was held not liable\\nfor abetment of suicide.596.'), ('306.9', 'Pressure for accounting proceeds—importance of suicide note.—\\nThe deceased was the owner of a ﬁnance ﬁrm.

The latter pressurised the deceased as a result of\\nwhich he committed suicide.\\nThis fact ﬁgured in the suicide note. The Court attached importance to this fact and\\nheld the accused guilty of causing abetment.597.'), ('306.10', 'Pressure for parting with s t r e e d h a n .—\\nThe accused was forcing his wife to transfer the land to his name which she had\\nreceived as a part of her streedhan from her father.

Following this, it was held that where two persons were\\nin love with a married woman and quarrelled over her and one of them (the accused)\\nalong with the lady taunted the other to commit suicide. The frustration thus caused\\nled him to suicide. It was held that no fault could be found with cognizance of the\\noffence under section 306.601.'), ('306.13', 'Abetment by defamation.—\\nThe publication of a defamatory article against the victim was held to be not suﬃcient\\nabetment for leading the victim to suicide.602.'), ('306.14', 'Abetment by rape.—\\nThe Supreme Court examined the possibility of such an abetment, but there was no\\npunishment because the incident of rape itself could not be proved. The suicide was\\ncommitted by the woman more than ﬁve and a half months after the incident. Her\\nstatements could not be regarded as dying declaration because there were no\\ncircumstances at the time which were related with her death. There was delay in\\nlodging FIR and also in conducting medical examination. There was no evidence to\\nconnect the accused with the crime. The cause for commission of suicide was not\\nlegally proved.603. Where the suicide was allegedly committed because of rape, if the\\nrape is not proved, conviction of accused for abetment to suicide is not proper.604.'), ('306.15', 'Instigation from Superior oﬃcers.—\\nIn Madan Mohan Singh v State of Gujarat,605. the deceased was a driver in the\\nMicrowave Project Department. He had undergone a bypass surgery for his heart, just\\nbefore the occurrence of such incident and his doctor had advised him against\\nperforming any stressful duties. The accused was a superior oﬃcer to the deceased.\\nWhen the deceased failed to comply with the orders of the accused, the accused\\nbecame very angry and threatened to suspend the deceased, rebuking him very harshly\\nfor not listening to him. The accused also asked the deceased how he still found the\\nwill to live, despite being insulted so the driver committed suicide. For the purpose of\\nbringing home any charge, vis-à-vis section 306/107 IPC, 1860 against the accused,\\nSupreme Court stated that there must be allegations to the effect that the accused had\\neither instigated the deceased in some way, to commit suicide or had engaged with\\nsome other persons in a conspiracy to do so, or that the accused had in some way\\naided any act or illegal omission to cause the said suicide. If the making of\\nobservations by a superior oﬃcer, regarding the work of his subordinate, is termed as\\nabetment to suicide, it would become almost impossible, for superior oﬃcers to\\ndischarge their duties as senior employees. In Vaijnath Kondiba Khandke v State of\\nMaharashtra,606. action was taken against the deceased and his salary was stopped for\\na month. The Supreme Court held that merely on that count it cannot be said that there\\nwas guilty mind or criminal intent to drive a person to commit suicide. That action\\nsimplicitor cannot be considered to be pointer against such superior oﬃcer for\\nattracting section 306 IPC, 1860, unless the situation is created deliberately so as to\\ndrive a person to commit suicide.'), ('306.16', 'Instigation by principal/Teachers.—\\nStudent committed suicide, because the Principal scolded, hit and asked him to\\napologise before students in the assembly, when gutka pouches were recovered from\\nhis bag.

In Chitresh\\nKumar Chopra v State (Govt of NCT of Delhi),613. the Supreme Court reiterated the legal\\nposition laid down in its earlier three Judges Bench judgment in the case of Ramesh\\nKumar v State of Chhattisgarh,614. and held that where the accused by his acts or\\ncontinued course of conduct creates such circumstances that the deceased was left\\nwith no other option except to commit suicide, an instigation may be inferred.

It is also in evidence that they taunted her for\\ncarrying an illegitimate child. All this … caused depression in her mind and drove her to take\\nthe extreme step of putting an end to her life by sprinkling kerosene oil on person and\\nsetting it aﬁre.

The ﬁndings arrived at by the High Court without considering the circumstantial\\nevidence as well as the evidence of prosecution witnesses cannot be sustained. As such\\nthe ﬁndings of the High Court are liable to be reversed and set aside.\\nThe Supreme Court has reiterated in Wazir Chand v State of Haryana618. that before\\nsection 306 can be acted upon, there must be clear proof of the fact that the death in\\nquestion was a suicidal death. In this case the evidence adduced was not able to justify\\na ﬁnding of suicide. The only other possibility was accidental burning of the newly-\\nmarried woman though she was being victimised for insuﬃcient dowry and there is no\\nchance of an accident being abetted.

A places the food on Z's table or delivers it\\nto Z's servant to place it on Z's table. A has committed the offence deﬁned\\nin this section.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nAttempt to murder.—This and the following section seem to apply to attempts to\\nmurder, in which there has been not merely a commencement of an execution of the\\npurpose, but something little short of a complete execution, the consummation being\\nhindered by circumstances independent of the will of the author. The act or omission,\\nalthough it does not cause death, is carried to such a length as, at the time of carrying\\nit to that length, the offender considers suﬃcient to cause death.634.\\nThe essential ingredients required to be proved in the case of an offence under section\\n307 are:\\n(i) that the death of a human being was attempted;\\n(ii) that such death was attempted to be caused by, or in consequence of the act of\\nthe accused; and\\n(iii) that such act was done with the intention of causing death; or that it was done\\nwith the intention of causing such bodily injury as:\\n(a) the accused knew to be likely to cause death; or\\n(b) was suﬃcient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or that the\\naccused attempted to cause death by doing an act known to him to be\\nso imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause (a) death, or\\n(b) such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the accused having no\\nexcuse for incurring the risk of causing such death or injury.635.\\nTo justify a conviction under this section, it is not essential that bodily injury capable of\\ncausing death should have been inﬂicted. Although the nature of injury actually caused\\nmay often give considerable assistance in coming to a ﬁnding as to the intention of the\\naccused, such intention may also be deduced from other circumstances, and may even,\\nin some cases, be ascertained without any reference at all to actual wounds. The\\nsection makes a distinction between an act of the accused and its result, if any. Such\\nan act may not be attended by any result so far as the person assaulted is concerned,\\nbut still there may be cases in which the culprit would be liable under this section. It is\\nnot necessary that the injury actually caused to the victim of the assault should be\\nsuﬃcient under ordinary circumstances to cause the death of the person assaulted.\\nWhat the Court has to see is whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with\\nthe intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section. An\\nattempt in order to be criminal need not be the penultimate act. It is suﬃcient in law, if\\nthere is present an intent coupled with some over act in execution thereof.636. To bring\\na case within the ambit of section 307, the prosecution has to make out the facts and\\ncircumstances envisaged by section 300. If the ingredients of section 300 are wholly\\nlacking, there can be no conviction under section 307.637. The ingredients of the\\nsection are (1) intention or knowledge relating to commission of murder; and (2) the\\ndoing of an act towards it.638. The Supreme Court held in Pulicherla Nagaraju v State of\\nAP that:\\nThe intention to cause death can be gathered generally from a combination of a few or\\nseveral of the following, among other, circumstances: (i) nature of the weapon used; (ii)\\nwhether the weapon was carried by the accused or was picked up from the spot; (iii)\\nwhether the blow is aimed at a vital part of the body; (iv) the amount of force employed in\\ncausing injury; (v) whether the act was in the course of sudden quarrel or sudden ﬁght or\\nfree for all ﬁght; (vi) whether the incident occurs by chance or whether there was any pre-\\nmeditation; (vii) whether there was any prior enmity or whether the deceased was a\\nstranger; (viii) whether there was any grave and sudden provocation, and if so, the cause for\\nsuch provocation; (ix) whether it was in the heat of passion; (x) whether the person inﬂicting\\nthe injury has taken undue advantage or has acted in a cruel and unusual manner; (xi)\\nwhether the accused dealt a single blow or several blows. The above list of circumstances\\nis, of course, not exhaustive and there may be several other special circumstances with\\nreference to individual cases which may throw light on the question of intention.639.\\nIn a group clash, one person died and several others were injured, some of them\\nseriously. The accused also received injuries. Two of the accused were convicted under\\nsection 307 and others under section 324. The Supreme Court held that, though the\\ninjuries caused by the two accused were somewhat serious, the offence for attempt to\\nmurder was not made out as their case stood on the same footing as that of others\\nand altered their conviction to one under section 324.640.\"), ('307.1', 'Attempt.—\\nAttempt is an intentional preparatory action which fails in its object—which so fails\\nthrough circumstances independent of the person who seeks its accomplishment.641.\\nThe mere use of lethal weapons is suﬃcient to invoke the provisions of section\\nblows successively with an axe on the head of the victim. It was held that the intention\\nto cause death could be gathered from the circumstances.643. It is not necessary to\\nconstitute the offence that the attack should result in an injury. An attempt is itself\\nsuﬃcient if there is requisite intention. An intention to murder can be gathered from\\ncircumstances other than the existence or nature of the injury.644.\\nTo attract the offence the injury need not be caused to vital parts.645.'), ('307.2', 'Whether act committed must be capable of causing death.—\\nThe section makes a distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any.\\nThe Court has to see whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the\\nintention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section. Therefore,\\nan accused charged under section 307 IPC, 1860 cannot be acquitted merely because\\nthe injuries inﬂicted on the victim were in the nature of a simple hurt.646. It is not\\nessential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inﬂicted in order\\nthat the charge under section 307 be made out. It is enough if there is an intention\\ncoupled with some common act in execution thereof.647. In Hari Singh,648. the Supreme\\nCourt added that:\\nthe intention or knowledge of the accused must be such as is necessary to constitute\\nmurder. Without this ingredient being established there can be no offence of attempt to\\nmurder … The intention is to be gathered from all the circumstances, and not merely from\\nthe consequences that ensue.\\nThe nature of the weapon used, the manner in which it is used, motive for the crime,\\nseverity of the blow, and the part of the body where the injury is inﬂicted, are some of\\nthe factors that may be taken into consideration to determine the intention.'), ('307.3', 'Acting in self-defence.—\\nThe accused alleged that he was attacked by the assailant party. The plea seemed to\\nthe Court to be true because there was no explanation from the prosecution side about\\ninjuries sustained by the accused. The medical papers of the complainant did not\\nmention the name of the assailant though it was a medico-legal case. The conviction\\nof the accused for attempt to murder was held liable to be set aside.649.'), ('307.4', 'Rape on young girl.—\\nWhere the accused took away a girl of four years to a lonely place near a canal,\\nsexually assaulted her and threw her in the canal, but was saved by a passer-by, his\\nsentence of three years RI with ﬁne of Rs. 500 under section 307 was raised to seven\\nyears RI and ﬁne of Rs. 1,000.650.'), ('307.5', 'Simple hurt.—\\n90 (P&H), two accused had altercation with a worker because of offering his labour at low wage,\\none of them struck the victim with gandasi at head, there being no such common intention, the\\nIntention is an essential ingredient of the offence of attempt to murder. Where the\\ninjuries caused were simple in nature and also not on vital parts of the body, the Court\\nsaid that the intention for attempt to murder could not be inferred. The Court held that\\nno offence under section 324 was made out because injuries were caused with a\\nsharp-cutting weapon.651. Where the accused persons had no common intention to kill\\nor have knowledge that death was likely to ensue but only intended to vent their ire\\nagainst their neighbour for having assaulted their bullocks, when the injuries sustained\\nby the injured persons were simple in nature, the Supreme Court held the accused\\npersons cannot be convicted under section 307 r/w 34.652.'), ('307.6', 'Nature of injuries is not determinative.—\\nThe nature of injuries has been held by the Supreme Court to be not a determinative\\nfactor. The framing of charge was challenged in this case on the ground that the\\ninjuries inﬂicted on the victim were simple in nature and no injury was found on any\\nvital part of the body. The determinative factor is intention or knowledge and not the\\nnature of injury.653. The circumstances that the injury inﬂicted by the accused was\\nsimple or minor will not by itself rule out application of section 307, IPC, 1860. The\\ndeterminative question is the intention or knowledge, as the case may be, and not\\nnature of the injury.654.'), ('307.7', 'Section 307 and Section 326.—\\nA bare perusal of these two provisions clearly reveals that while section 307 IPC, 1860\\nuses the words \"under such circumstances\", these words are conspicuously missing\\nfrom section 326 IPC, 1860. Therefore, while deciding whether the case falls under\\nsection 307 IPC, 1860 or under section 326 IPC, 1860 the Court must necessarily\\nexamine the circumstances in which the assault was made. Considering the fact that\\nthe assault was made after some premeditation and pre-planning, considering the fact\\nthat assault was carried out in the dead of the night, considering the nature of the\\nweapon, used, nature of the injuries caused, obviously, the present case falls under the\\nambit of section 307 IPC, 1860 and not under section 326 IPC, 1860.

It is a unique legal phenomenon in the IPC,\\n1860 that the only act, the attempt of which alone will become an offence. The person\\nwho attempts to commit suicide is guilty of the offence under section 309 IPC, 1860\\nwhereas the person who committed suicide cannot be reached at all. Section 306\\nrenders the person who abets the commission of suicide punishable for which the\\ncondition precedent is that suicide should necessarily have been committed.665.\\nThe act done must be in the course of the attempt, otherwise no offence is committed.\\nWhere a woman with the intention of committing suicide by throwing herself in a well,\\nactually ran towards it, when she was seized by a person, it was held that she might\\nhave changed her mind, and she was caught before she did anything which might have\\nbeen regarded as the commencement of the offence.666. Her act simply amounted to\\npreparation. The pounding of oleander roots with an intention to poison oneself with\\nthe same was held not to constitute this offence.667. Where the accused jumped into a\\nwell to avoid and escape from police, and when rescued he came out of the well of his\\nown accord, it was held that, in the absence of evidence that he jumped into the well to\\ncommit suicide, he could not be convicted of this offence.668. A village woman of 20\\nyears old was ill-treated by her husband. There was a quarrel between the two, and the\\nhusband threatened that he would beat her. Late that night the woman, taking her six\\nmonths\\' old baby in her arms, slipped away from the house. After she had gone some\\ndistance she heard somebody coming up behind her, and when she turned round and\\nsaw her husband pursuing her, she got into a panic and jumped down a well nearby\\nwith the baby in her arms. The result was that the baby died but the woman recovered.\\nOne of the charges against her was attempt to commit suicide. It was held that she\\nshould not be convicted under this section of an attempt to commit suicide, for the\\nword \"attempt\" connotes some conscious endeavour to accomplish the act, and the\\naccused in jumping down the well was not thinking at all of taking her own life but only\\nof escaping from her husband.669. If a person openly declares that he will fast to death\\nand then proceeds to refuse all nourishment until the stage is reached when there is\\nimminent danger of death ensuing, he can be held guilty under this section but when\\nthe evidence falls short of this, it cannot be said to be suﬃcient to sustain the\\ncharge.670. A woman who had been suffering from chronic incurable disease retired to\\nbed with her one and a half-year-old child but was found with the child inside a well\\nabout 200 feet away from her house in the early morning of the next day when they\\nwere both taken out of the well, it was found that though the woman was alive the child\\nhad died. On being prosecuted under sections 302 and 309 IPC, 1860, she denied\\nhaving jumped into the well. She further pleaded that she was too ill and there was\\nsomething wrong with her brain. The trial Judge did not give her the beneﬁt of section\\n84 IPC, 1860 and convicted her of both the offences charged. In acquitting her the High\\nCourt of Bombay held that in the absence of any evidence that she deliberately jumped\\ninto the well along with the child, she could not be convicted merely on the basis of\\nimagination or denied the beneﬁt of section 84 IPC, 1860. In any case, the Judge\\nshould have given her the beneﬁt of doubt.671. Moreover, suspicion however strong is\\nnot proof.672. Where a desolate woman jumped into a well with her two children and\\nwas released with admonition for the offence under section 309 but was sentenced to\\nimprisonment for three months for the offence under section 307 IPC, 1860, the\\nSupreme Court directed that she should also be released with admonition for the\\noffence under section 307 IPC, 1860.673. Witness clearly stated that deceased was\\nshouting, pleading with the accused to not kill her, when accused gave sword blows to\\nher. There is no material available to establish that deceased volunteered herself for\\ndeath — Exception 5 to section 300 could not be invoked. Conviction and sentence, as\\nrecorded by trial Court under sections 302 and 309 of IPC, 1860 against appellant was\\nheld proper.674.'), ('309.1', \"Voluntary termination of life.—\\nA person cannot claim his own life by saying that he had led a successful life and the\\nmission of his life was fulﬁlled.

It added that\\nthe act of attempted suicide has no baneful effect on society and it is also not against\\nreligion, morality or public policy, besides suicide or attempt to commit it causes no\\nharm to others.\\nThis decision was subsequently reversed and it has been held again that the provision\\nfor penalising attempt to commit suicide and abetment of suicide is not\\nunconstitutional.679.\\nThe Constitution Bench in a subsequent decision in Gian Kaur v State of Punjab680. and\\nother connected matters has overruled the view taken in the case of P Rathinam681.\\nthat section 309 IPC, 1860 is constitutionally invalid.

By inverting the presumption against\\nguilt but retaining the provision in the statute book, attempt to suicide is still a criminal\\noffence. In order to render conviction, prosecution will be required to lead evidence and\\nprove that the survivor did not have severe stress and did not suffer any issue of\\nmental health.'), ('309.5', \"Euthanasia.—\\nIn India active euthanasia is illegal and a crime under section 302 or at least section\\n304 IPC, 1860. Physician assisted suicide is a crime under section 306 IPC, 1860\\n(abetment to suicide). The Constitution Bench in Gian Kaur v State of Punjab,683. held\\nthat both euthanasia and assisted suicide are not lawful in India which overruled the\\ntwo Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court in P Rathinam v UOI.684. The Court\\nheld that the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution does not include the right\\nto die. But in Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v UOI,685. the Supreme Court held that\\npassive euthanasia can be allowed under exceptional circumstances under the strict\\nmonitoring of the Court. The difference between 'active' and passive' euthanasia is that\\nin active euthanasia something is done to end the patient's life while in passive\\neuthanasia, something is not done that would have preserved the patient's life. It is\\nusually deﬁned as withdrawing medical treatment with a deliberate intention to causing\\nthe patient's death. In Common Cause (A Regd.

Conviction of ﬁrst\\naccused under section 304 Part II and co-accused under section 323 IPC, 1860 was\\nheld proper.743. Where accused having sticks in their hands entered the house of\\ncomplainant and assaulted him, the overt act attributed to accused by witnesses is\\nspeciﬁc, medical evidence fully supports the case of prosecution and\\naccused/respondent is liable to be convicted under section 323 of IPC, 1860.744. The\\naccused, a shopkeeper, in a sudden quarrel hit his wife on the head with an iron weight\\nof 200 grams which resulted in her death. The medical evidence showed that the injury\\nwas of a simple nature and there was no evidence that the deceased died of shock\\ncaused by the injury. He was held liable only under section 323 IPC, 1860 and not under\\nsection 304 IPC, 1860.745. So also where the wife attacked the husband with a brick\\ncausing multiple injuries resulting in his death but according to medical evidence the\\ninjuries were of a simple nature and were not suﬃcient in ordinary course of nature to\\ncause death, it was held that the accused wife could not be convicted under section\\n302 IPC, 1860. Her conviction was accordingly changed to one under section 323 IPC,\\nThe accused pushed the victim. She fell down and sustained injuries of simple nature.\\nThis act of the accused was held to fall under section 323.747. Where the accused gave\\na push on the chest of the deceased and the victim fell on a stone resulting in death,\\nconviction was recorded under section 323.748. The accused husband returned home\\nat midnight in a drunken state. He beat his wife and threw a piece of stone on her head\\nand she died. The post-mortem report revealed three simple injuries on her head and\\nexact cause of death could not be ascertained. Relations between the accused and the\\ndeceased were found to be cordial. Intention to cause the victim's death was not\\nproved. Conviction of the accused under section 300 was set aside and he was\\nconvicted under section 323.749. Several persons attacked and caused the death of\\ntheir victim. All, including the present appellant, were holding the deceased and one of\\nthem K dealt fatal blows. K was convicted of murder under section 302. All his fellows\\nwere convicted under this section read with section 149 except the present appellant\\nwho was convicted under section 302 read with section 34. The Supreme Court held\\nthat the appellant should also have been convicted under this section read with section\\nsubdural haematoma which led to the death of the victim, but it could not be said that\\nthe accused could be attributed with the knowledge that by such act he was likely to\\ncause death, nor could it be said that the accused intended to cause that particular\\ninjury which he actually caused, it was held that accused could be convicted only under\\nsection 323 and not section 300. In Mohan Singh v State of Rajasthan,752. the accused\\nattacked his victim and caused voluntary hurt to him by inﬂicting ﬁst blows and\\ncausing nose injury. His guilt was established by the evidence of the witnesses. The\\nplea of alibi raised by the accused was not tenable. His conviction under section 323\\nwas upheld.\\nWhere the offence was punishable under this section and also under sections 304, Part\\nII/34, and was covered by the Uttar Pradesh Children Act, 1951, the Court did not\\nconsider it proper to subject children to imprisonment but, looking at the brutal nature\\nof the offence, imposed a sentence of ﬁne.753.\\nWhere the accused brothers chanced to converge, having not met before, at their\\nsister's place avowedly to teach her a lesson for having instituted proceedings against\\nthem and one of them who, not known to others was carrying a knife, inﬂicted a knife\\nblow which, landing on a vital part, caused death, they were convicted under this\\nsection and the knife wielding brother under section 304 Part-II.754. In a case of\\nattempt to murder, one of the accused gave only one blow with a 'lathi' on the shoulder\\nof the injured without sharing the common intention of the other accused. Injury was\\nsimple and caused only swelling. He was convicted for his individual act under section\\n323 and was released on probation.755.\"), ('323.2', 'Conviction altered to 323.—\\nWhere the Doctor had clearly established that the injuries sustained by the deceased\\nwere all simple in nature inﬂicted upon non-vital parts of the body.

Where a head injury was caused with a deadly weapon and the injured was\\ndischarged from the hospital after 15 days, but six months thereafter he had to be\\nhospitalised again for brain operation and he did not recover, the death being not solely\\ndue to the injury, the accused persons convicted under this section and their conviction\\nunder section 304 was set aside.767. Tooth is an instrument of cutting and as such\\nbiting off the tip of the nose would be an offence under this section or section 326 IPC,\\n1860 depending on the nature of the injury, simple or grievous.768. Where there is no\\nserious injury on any vital part of the body of the victim, the offender should be\\nconvicted under section 324 and not under section 326 IPC, 1860.769. Thus, where the\\naccused inﬂicted an injury on the right shoulder of the deceased with a broken soda\\nwater bottle with sharp edges without knowing that the deceased was suffering from\\nhaemophilia (tendency of excessive bleeding), it was held that the accused was liable\\nonly under section 324 and not under section 302 IPC, 1860.770. Where simple injuries\\nnot likely to cause death were inﬂicted with a sword, the Supreme Court transferred the\\nconviction from under section 307 to one under this section and allowed the offences\\nto be compounded on payment to the victim a sum of Rs. 3,000.771. Where in a case of\\na dowry death, the evidence showed that the accused, mother-in-law caused injuries on\\nthe person of the daughter-in-law. She committed suicide. The accused was punished\\nunder section 324 but on consideration of circumstances and facts that she was 80,\\nonly a sentence of ﬁne of Rs. 3,000 was imposed.

Where a blow was inﬂicted with the\\nblunt side of the axe on the thigh of the victim, the Supreme Court reduced the\\nsentence to four months' RI and increased the ﬁne to Rs. 3,000.775. Where the accused\\ndeliberately attacked and killed a person with a deadly weapon and was held to be\\nrightly convicted for murder under section 300, he was convicted under this section\\nand sentenced to pay a ﬁne for causing hurt on the hand of the intervening wife of the\\ndeceased with a rice pounder.776.\\nIn a free ﬁght between two groups resulting in death of one person and injuries to\\nseveral others, fatal injury could not be attributed to any one of the accused who also\\nreceived a number of injuries. It was held that the accused were properly convicted\\nunder sections 324 and 325.777. Where one of the accused caused two gunshot\\ninjuries to a man which proved fatal, the other accused caused him only an incised\\ninjury. The accused causing fatal injuries was sentenced under section 302 and the\\nother accused only under section 324.778. In an altercation the accused dealt a blow\\nwith spade lying on the spot on the head of a 70-year-old man who became\\nunconscious, was hospitalised and died after three weeks. The blow caused only linear\\nfracture of left frontal bone. It was found that essential element of voluntarily causing\\ngrievous hurt was wanting.

On ﬁrst occasion accused\\nﬁred in air and pellets after being ricocheted from ceiling caused simple injuries to\\nthree persons. On second occasion also appellant had not caused any injury to\\nanybody. In view of dearth of convincing evidence on record, it cannot be concluded\\nwith any degree of certainty that appellant had an intention to commit murder of\\nanybody. Only conclusion could be drawn is that appellant wanted to cause hurt for\\ndispersing crowd. Appellant can only be convicted under section 324 of IPC, 1860 and\\nnot under section 307 IPC, 1860.780.

Where the injured witness himself attributed the injury on\\nhim to the deceased, instead of the accused, the conviction of the accused on the\\ncharge of section 324 cannot be sustained under law.785. Where no explanation by\\nprosecution as to how the injuries were caused to deceased and the role attributed to\\nappellants by prosecution is fully covered by their right of private defence, conviction\\nand sentence is liable to be set aside.786. In a case, the allegation was that the accused\\npetitioner inﬂicted simple and grievous injuries with sharp-edged weapon on person of\\nvictim.

Before a conviction for the sentence of grievous hurt\\ncan be passed, one of the injuries deﬁned in section 320 must be strictly proved, and\\nthe eighth clause is no exception to the general rule of law that a penal statute must be\\nconstrued strictly. The expression \"any instrument which, used as a weapon of offence,\\nis likely to cause death\" has to be gauged taking note of the heading of the section.\\nThe essential ingredients to attract section 326 are:\\n(1) voluntarily causing a hurt;\\n(2) hurt caused must be a grievous hurt; and\\n(3) the grievous hurt must have been caused by dangerous weapons or means.806.'), ('326.1', 'Dangerous weapon.—\\nWhat would constitute a \\'dangerous weapon\\' would depend upon the facts of each\\ncase and no generalisation can be made. The heading of the section provides some\\ninsight into the factors to be considered. As was noted by the Supreme Court in State\\nof UP v Indrajeet alias Sukhatha,807. there is no such thing as a regular or earmarked\\nweapon for committing murder or for that matter a hurt. Whether a particular article\\ncan per se cause any serious wound or grievous hurt or injury has to be determined\\nfactually. At this juncture, it would be relevant to note that in some provisions, e.g.,\\nsections 324 and 326 expression \"dangerous weapon\" is used. In some other more\\nserious offences the expression used is \"deadly weapon\" (e.g., sections 397 and 398).\\nThe facts involved in a particular case, depending upon various factors like size,\\nsharpness, would throw light on the question whether the weapon was a dangerous or\\ndeadly weapon or not. That would determine whether in the case section 325 or\\nsection 326 would be applicable.808.\\nIn the absence of any evidence that the stick which was used as a weapon of offence\\nwas of lethal type and something like sharp blade or sharp point, etc., was attached to\\nit, the stick was held to be not an instrument within the meaning of this section.809.\\nWhere the accused-teacher assaulted the child-student with a wooden stick that\\ncaused injury to the eye of the child but there was no material to show that the stick\\nthat was wielded by the accused was a dangerous weapon, the conviction of the\\naccused under section 326 may not be warranted; but the offence would fall under\\nsection 325 IPC, 1860.810.'), ('326.2', \"Injuries not serious enough to endanger life.—\\nIt was proved that the accused persons caused injuries which led to the victim's death.\\nHe did not receive any medical assistance for full four hours. He lost a lot of blood\\nwhich became the cause of death. None of the injuries were on the vital parts of the\\nbody. They were not serious enough to endanger life by themselves. The Court said\\nthat at the highest, the accused persons could be said to be guilty under sections\\n326/34 for causing grievous hurt.811. In an altercation the accused persons beat the\\ninjured with ﬁst and leg blows on stomach and waist. An attempt was made to help\\nhim out of the injury by fomenting at home. But he had to be shifted to hospital and\\noperated upon. It was held that the accused was guilty of attempt to cause grievous\\nhurt and not attempt to murder.812. The accused persons armed with lathis and a tangi\\nwent to the ﬁeld of the victims and picked up a ﬁght while they were ploughing their\\nﬁeld. Looking at the attack they ran away. On their way back they met the uncle of their\\nvictims who happened to ask them about the matter. They being annoyed by the\\nquestion, hit him on the head with a lathi. He died. The Court viewed the act as only one\\nintended to cause grievous hurt. Sentence of ﬁve years RI was awarded.813.\"), ('326.3', 'Internal injuries.—\\nOn account of a quarrel, the husband kicked his wife in the abdomen and chest. Liver\\ninjuries were caused of which she died. Conviction was recorded under section 326.\\nThere was no appeal by the State for any higher punishment. There was no evidence to\\nsuggest any dowry demand. Hence, there could be no conviction under section\\n498A.814.'), ('326.4', 'Disﬁguration.—\\nThe wife of the accused was being taken to a Police Station in execution of search\\nwarrant accompanied by a police constable. The accused assaulted his wife and\\ncaused injuries resulting in amputation of her limbs. The whole nose was also cut,\\nwhich itself was held to be suﬃcient to attract permanent disﬁguration. Conviction of\\nthe accused under section 326 was not interfered with.815.'), ('326.5', 'Burn Injuries.—\\nIncident of throwing burning Kerosene Lamp by accused on complainant and the\\ncomplainant sustained 25–30 per cent burn injuries on chest, abdomen and hands.\\nDoctor clariﬁed that burn injuries are fatal and dangerous to life in case the injuries get\\ninfected and develop into septicaemia. Therefore, injuries cannot be said to be fatal.\\nAccused was liable to be convicted only under section 326 of IPC, 1860 not under\\nsection 307.816.'), ('326.6', 'Acid attack.—\\nThe accused threw acid on the faces of their victims. Medical evidence showed that\\nthe injuries caused on the faces and eyes were not suﬃcient to cause death, conviction\\nof the accused under section 307 was altered to one under section 326. The Court\\nobserved that unless it can be shown that the intention or knowledge of the accused\\nwas to cause such bodily injury as would come within one of the four clauses of\\nsection 300, he cannot be held guilty of an offence under section 307.817.'), ('326.7', 'Attack with axe.—\\nProtest against cutting of trees became the cause for assault. The accused and his\\ncompanions started assaulting. The victim received a head injury with an axe. The blow\\ncaused fracture because of its force. The accused persons were not entitled to the\\nbeneﬁt of private defence, they being the aggressors.818.'), ('326.8', 'Attack with piece of stone.—\\nThe weapon of assault was a piece of stone. As per the evidence of the doctor, the\\ninjury caused was grievous one. But considering the size of the stone used for the\\npurpose, it could not be said that a dangerous weapon was used. The conviction was\\naltered to section 325 from section 326.819.'), ('326.9', 'Counter case.—\\nIn a case the accused inﬂicted a knife blow to a man and the accused was also injured\\nduring the same incident and ﬁled a counter case but took no steps to bring his case to\\ntrial. It was held that ﬁling of the counter case was not fatal to the prosecution case\\nthough both the cases should have been clubbed together. Conviction of the accused\\nunder section 326 was upheld.820. The eye-witnesses who deny the presence of\\ninjuries on the person of the accused are lying on the most material point, and\\ntherefore, their evidence is unreliable.821.'), ('326.10', 'Feeding p r a s a d  containing poison.—\\nThe accused distributed prasad to persons on relay fast. It contained poison. One\\nperson died, others affected. The Court was of the view that it could not be said that\\nthere was intention to kill a particular person, distribution being made openly. But\\nbecause the accused must have had knowledge that a poisonous substance may\\ncause grievous hurt or even death. In respect of the death he was convicted under\\nsection 304, Part I and in respect of others affected under section 326.822.'), ('326.11', 'Protest against eve-teasing.—\\nThe accused were friends of the victim who had objected to eve-teasing by one of\\nthem. The victim-protestor was assaulted. It was held that they could be convicted\\nindividually for their role in the assault under section 326 but not for the murder. There\\nwas no common intention of going to that extent.823.'), ('326.12', \"Uncertainty as to cause of death.—\\nThe ﬁrst doctor who examined the injured person in the hospital stated that none of the\\ninjuries either individually or collectively appeared to be dangerous to life. The doctor\\nwho last examined the patient stated that 'A' group blood having been exhausted, 'O'\\ngroup blood was given and death might have been due to blood reaction. The post-\\nmortem doctor stated that death was due to rupture of liver.

Therefore, while deciding whether the case falls\\nunder section 307 IPC, 1860 or under section 326 IPC, 1860 the Court must necessarily\\nexamine the circumstances in which the assault was made.827. Doctor categorically\\nstated that injury could have caused death. Radiologist also stated that chopping of the\\nleg was grievous act in nature. The Supreme Court held that High Court was not\\njustiﬁed in altering conviction from section 307 read with section 149 to 326 read with\\nsection 149 IPC, 1860.828. Number of injures were quite grievous but accused were\\ncareful not to give any blow on any vital part of body. Doctor did not say that injuries\\nwere suﬃcient in the course of nature to cause death. Therefore, accused was\\nconvicted under section 326 IPC, 1860 instead of section 307 IPC, 1860.829.'), ('326.15', \"Punishment.—\\nImposing only ﬁne while convicting the accused under section 326 and not imposing\\npunishment of imprisonment, was held to be a non-compliance of the provisions of the\\ncode.830. Accused poured acid on the head of victim with the result that face, neck,\\neyes, chest, etc., were seriously burnt. High Court reduced sentence from three years to\\nalready undergone (35 days). For such a heinous crime accused deserves no\\nleniency.831.\\nIn a case,832. the Supreme Court held the imposition of three months' imprisonment to\\nbe proper but pointed out that the Courts below should have taken notice of the\\nprovisions of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 or of section 360 Cr PC, 1973. While\\nupholding the sentence, the Court directed the prisoner to be released on probation.\\nOften in Court at the sentencing stage the spotlight fell almost entirely upon the\\noffender and the circumstances of the offender, and there was seldom reference to the\\nsuffering of the victim of violence.833.\"), ('326.16', \"Offence not compoundable.—\\nIn Suresh Babu v State of AP,834. Supreme Court allowed the compounding of an\\noffence under section 326 IPC, 1860 even though such compounding was not\\npermitted by section 320 of the Code. However, in Surendra Nath Mohanty v State of\\nOrissa,835. and in Ramlal v State of Jammu and Kashmir,836. it was held that an offence\\nwhich law declares to be non-compoundable cannot be compounded at all even with\\nthe permission of the Court and held Suresh Babu,837. per incuriam. In Jalaluddin v State\\nof UP,838. and in Bankat v State,839. the Apex Court reiterated that as the offence under\\nsection 326, IPC, 1860 is not compoundable, even if the parties settled the matter. In\\nRamgopal v State of MP,840. Supreme Court held as follows:\\nThere are several offences under the IPC that are currently non - compoundable. These\\ninclude offences punishable u/s. 498-A, s. 326, etc. of the IPC. Some of such offence can be\\nmade compoundable by introducing a suitable amendment in the statute. We are of the\\nopinion that the Law Commission of India could examine whether a suitable proposal can\\nbe sent to the Union Government in this regard. Any such step would not only relieve the\\nCourts of the burden of deciding cases in which the aggrieved parties have themselves\\narrived at a settlement, but may also encourage the process of reconciliation between them.\\nWe, accordingly, request the Law Commission and the Government of India to examine all\\nthese aspects and take such steps as may be considered feasible.\\nThe Law Commission of India examined the issue in view of the direction in Ramgopal's\\nCase and submitted its 237th Report suggesting to make section 498A and section\\n324 compoundable: no changes were suggested regarding section 326. In Gian Singh v\\nState of Punjab,841. a three-Judge Bench held that sub-section (9) of section 320\\nmandates that no offence shall be compounded except as provided by this section.\\nObviously, in view thereof the composition of an offence has to be in accord with\\nsection 320 and in no other manner. But the power of compounding of offences given\\nto a Court under section 320 is materially different from the quashing of criminal\\nproceedings by the High Court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction. In compounding\\nof offences, power of a criminal Court is circumscribed by the provisions contained in\\nsection 320 and the Court is guided solely and squarely thereby while, on the other\\nhand, the formation of opinion by the High Court for quashing a criminal offence or\\ncriminal proceeding or criminal complaint is guided by the material on record as to\\nwhether the ends of justice would justify such exercise of power although the ultimate\\nconsequence may be acquittal or dismissal of indictment. The result is, though section\\n326 IPC, 1860 is a non-compoundable offence, the High Court can quash the\\n1956).\\n2008 SC 2354] .\\n2008 SC 2354] ; Mathai v State of Kerala, 2005 (2) JT 365 .\\nagriculturists and not seasoned or regular criminals, there was neither brutality nor\\npremeditation, they had served considerable period of time in custody during the trial.

A wrongful conﬁnement is a wrongful restraint in such a\\nmanner as to prevent that person from proceeding beyond a certain circumscribed\\nlimits. This offence has nothing to do with the investigation or search.949.

The factual scenario clearly establishes commission by the appellant as\\nwell of the offence punishable under section 342 IPC, 1860.950. Conﬁnement need not\\nnecessarily be a conﬁnement where the person is physically held within a certain\\ncircumscribed limit. To support the charge of wrongful conﬁnement, proof of actual\\nphysical obstruction is not essential.

This section says that 'force' becomes criminal\\n(1) when it is used without consent and in order to the committing of an offence, or (2)\\nwhen it is intentionally used to cause injury, fear or annoyance to another to whom the\\nforce is used. To attract the deﬁnition of 'criminal force' under section 350 IPC, 1860,\\nthere must be intentional use of force on any person, without that person's consent.\\nSuch force must have been used for committing an offence, or intending to cause, or\\nknowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or\\nannoyance to the person on whom the force is used. In other words, the criminal force\\ncontemplated under this section is intended to mean criminal force as applied to a\\nperson and not as applied to an inanimate object or substance.962. A person is said to\\nuse force when he causes motion or change of motion or cessation of motion to\\nanother person or the above in substance, which brings it into contact with any part of\\nthe other person's body or with anything that the other is wearing or carrying, or with\\nanything so situated that such contact affects other's sense of feeling. This should be\\ndone by his own bodily power or by use of some substance or by inducing any animal\\nto change this motion. The use of force will become criminal when it is done against\\nthe consent of any person with the intention of committing an offence or to cause\\ninjury, fear or annoyance to any person. In this case admittedly no assault was resorted\\nto.963.\\nThe term 'criminal force' includes what in English law is called 'battery'. It will, however,\\nbe remembered that 'criminal force' may be so slight as not to amount to an offence\\n(section 95), and it will be observed that 'criminal force' does not include anything that\\nthe doer does by means of another person.

      "[('353', 'Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his\\nduty.\\nWhoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the\\nexecution of his duty as such public servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that\\nperson from discharging his duty as such public servant, or in consequence of\\nanything done or attempted to be done by such person in the lawful discharge of his\\nduty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description\\nfor a term which may extend to two years or with ﬁne, or with both.\\nCOMMENT.—\\nThe public servant must be acting in the discharge of a duty imposed by law on him in\\nthe particular case, and the section will not protect him for an act done in good faith\\nunder colour of his oﬃce.977. If hurt is caused under the circumstances mentioned in\\nthe section then either section 332 or section 333 will apply.'), ('353.1', 'CASES.—Defect in warrant.—\\nIt is made clear in the illustrations that the words alone will not amount to assault. So\\nalso, the mere gesture of picking up a stick alone will not constitute assault unless\\naccompanied by other circumstances. The gesture explained by the words alone\\namounts to assault. Therefore, mere preparation of carrying a weapon and standing\\nbefore the victim without making any gesture which will disclose the intention or\\nknowledge will not constitute assault. As seen from Illustration (c), mere carrying a\\nstick without being accompanied by a statement which will disclose the intention or\\nknowledge will not constitute assault. But there is nothing in evidence to reveal\\ncommission of any of the overt acts to constitute offence under section 353 IPC, 1860.\\nThe prosecution has failed to prove any of the offences alleged against appellants.978.\\nResistance to an illegal order of attachment is not an offence under section 353, IPC,\\ndistributing ﬂood relief in village and made an attempt to snatch the cash and evidence\\nof witnesses was found cogent, convincing and credit worthy, conviction was\\nupheld.980. Accused allegedly snatched the service revolver of complainant police\\noﬃcer and ﬁred at him. All the witnesses who were independent witnesses, turned\\nhostile. Offence under sections 307 and 353 was held not proved.981.'), ('353.2', 'Search without proper order or warrant.—\\nWhere the accused resisted a public oﬃcer who attempted to search a house, in the\\nabsence of a proper written order authorizing him to do so, he was held to have\\ncommitted no offence under this section.982. But the Madras High Court has held that\\na search without a search warrant does not justify an obstruction or resistance to an\\noﬃcer, if he was acting in good faith and without malice.983. Even though an illegal\\nsearch under section 165, Cr PC, 1973 can be resisted, yet there is no justiﬁcation to\\nassault an oﬃcer after he has ﬁnished the search and left the house. Such an act\\namounts to an offence under section 353 IPC, 1860.984. In this connection see also\\nsub-head \"Cases\" under section 340 ante.'), ('353.3', \"Public servant must be acting in execution of duty.—\\nWhere the accused created hindrance in the discharge of duties of police in order to\\navoid arrest, it was held that conviction under section 353 was justiﬁed.985. Where a\\ncart owner refused to give his cart for the use of a Forest Settlement Oﬃcer who\\nrequired it as per executive orders of Government, and assaulted the peon in preventing\\nhim from seizing his cart, it was held that he could not be convicted of an offence\\nunder this section, because the rules aforesaid had not the force of law, and a public\\nservant acting under them was not acting in the execution of his duty.986. Similarly,\\nwhere a forest oﬃcer who was authorised to arrest a person only when the offence\\nwas committed within ﬁve miles of the border arrested the accused when there was no\\nevidence that the offence was committed within the ﬁve mile belt, it was held that the\\narrest not being justiﬁed, the accused did not commit any offence under this section by\\ninﬂicting some injuries on the oﬃcer during a scuﬄe.987. Legality of the execution of\\nduty is the sine qua non for the application of section 353 IPC, 1860.988. Where a\\nHeadmaster of a school was assaulted with a ruler by a fellow teacher out of previous\\npersonal grudge and not due to any performance of public duty, it was held that the\\naccused could not be convicted under section 353 though his conviction under section\\n325, IPC, 1860 was legal as the Headmaster suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder\\njoint.989. In this connection see also comments under section 332 ante. Where the\\nAssistant Superintendent of Commercial Taxes paid a surprise visit to the shop of the\\naccused and took up some books of account maintained by the shop for inspection, as\\nhe was empowered to do under the State's Sales Tax Law, and the accused snatched\\naway the books from him, it was held by the Supreme Court that the act of the accused\\namounted to use of criminal force and he could be convicted under this section. It was\\nobserved that to feel annoyed at this action of the accused would be the natural\\nreaction of the Assistant Superintendent.990. Where the driver of the Transport\\nDepartment prevented a Deputy Sarpanch from entering the bus through driver's cabin\\nand was kicked by the latter and thus suffered a grievous injury, it was held while\\ndriving or standing by the bus the driver was on public duty and by stopping a trespass\\ninto driver's cabin he was undoubtedly acting in the discharge of his duty as public\\nservant.

But\\nmaterial has to be placed on record to show that the intention is to cause alarm to the\\ncomplainant. Offence not made out.993.'), ('353.5', 'To deter public servant from discharging duty.—\\nWhere the accused was asked by a sub-inspector to stop his car and he while\\npretending to stop sped away and in this process hit the mudguard of the motor-cycle\\non which the Sub-Inspector was sitting, it was held that the facts of the case did not\\nmake out an offence of assault on a public servant or using criminal force so as to\\ndeter him from discharging his duties as public servant.994. The accused suspected\\nthat the complainant public servant was instrumental in his transfer. The complainant\\nwas proceeding to his oﬃce to resume his duty. On the way he was assaulted by the\\naccused. It was held that no offence was committed under section 353 because the\\npublic servant was not assaulted to deter him from discharge of his duty.995. The wife\\nof the accused was being taken to Police Station in execution of search warrant\\naccompanied by a police constable. The accused attacked his wife and also the police\\nconstable. Conviction of the accused under section 353 was held to be proper, though\\nno injury as such was caused to the constable. The Court observed that actual causing\\nof injury is not necessary for conviction under section 353.996. In a complaint under\\nsections 323 and 329 the investigating Head Constable demanded bribe for arresting\\nsome persons and was caught red-handed in a trap but on his call the villagers\\nattacked the raiding party and snatched away their belongings and currency notes used\\nin the trap, thus deterring the public servants from discharging their duties and\\nrescuing the accused from the lawful custody of the Inspector of the raiding party.\\nConviction of the Head Constable under section 395 read with section 109, sections\\n353/109 and 224, the constable whom the head constable handed over the money\\nunder section 395 and the villagers under sections 353, 149, 226 and 147 was\\nupheld.997. Four persons brought a woman to a room of a circuit house for the purpose\\nof prostitution. When one of them was busy in sexual intercourse and others were busy\\nin drinking, the police reached there and as they were about to arrest the accused, one\\nof the accused obstructed the police oﬃcers in discharge of their duties.

The ingredients of the two offences are distinct and different. While\\nthe former is a cognizable offence, the latter is not. A mere obstruction or resistance\\nunaccompanied by criminal force or assault will not constitute an offence under\\nsection 353 IPC, 1860. Where an accused voluntarily obstructs a public servant in the\\ndischarge of his duties, section 186 IPC, 1860 is attracted. But under section 353, there\\nmust be in addition to the obstruction use of criminal force or assault to the public\\nservant while he was discharging his duty. It may also be noted that the quality of the\\ntwo offences is also different. While section 186 occurs in Chapter X dealing with\\ncontempt of the lawful authority of public servants, section 353 appears in Chapter XVI\\nwhich deals with offences affecting the human body. This is also a clear indication that\\nuse of criminal force contemplated under section 353 IPC, 1860 is against a person\\nand not against any inanimate object.999.\\nCal 361 ; Provincial Government, Central Provinces and Berar v Nonelal, (1946) Nag 395.

Therefore, if any person uses criminal force upon any woman\\nwith the intention or knowledge that the woman\\'s modesty will be outraged, he is to be\\npunished. In Vishaka v State of Rajasthan,1001. and Apparel Export Promotion Council v\\nAK Chopra,1002. the Supreme Court held that the offence relating to modesty of woman\\ncannot be treated as trivial. In order to constitute the offence under section 354, IPC,\\n1860 mere knowledge that the modesty of a woman is likely to be outraged is suﬃcient\\nwithout any deliberate intention of such outrage alone for its object. There is no\\nabstract conception of modesty that can apply to all cases. A careful approach has to\\nbe adopted by the Court while dealing with a case alleging outrage of modesty.\\nThe essential ingredients of the offence under section 354, IPC, 1860 are as under:\\n(1) That the person assaulted must be a woman.\\n(2) Accused must have used criminal force on her intending thereby to outrage her\\nmodesty.\\n(3) What constitutes an outrage to female modesty is nowhere deﬁned—The\\nessence of a woman\\'s modesty is her sex.\\n(4) Act of pulling a woman, removing her dress coupled with a request for sexual\\nintercourse, as such would be an outrage to the modesty of a woman.\\n(5) Knowledge, that modesty is likely to be outraged, is suﬃcient to constitute the\\noffence without any deliberate intention of having such outrage alone for its\\nobject.1003.\\nIntention is not the sole criterion of the offence punishable under section 354, IPC,\\n1860 and it can be committed by a person assaulting or using criminal force to any\\nwoman, if he knows that by such act the modesty of the woman is likely to be affected.\\nKnowledge and intention are essentially things of the mind and cannot be\\ndemonstrated like physical objects. The existence of intention or knowledge has to be\\nculled out from various circumstances in which and upon whom the alleged offence is\\nalleged to have been committed.1004. Even though it is true that assault or criminal\\nforce to woman is one of the essential pre-conditions for applicability of section 354\\nIPC, 1860 but the same has to be with an intent to outrage her modesty or knowing it to\\nbe likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty. Neither the use of criminal force\\nalone nor act of outraging the modesty alone is suﬃcient to attract an offence under\\nsection 354 IPC, 1860.1005.'), ('354.1', 'Modesty.—Meaning.—\\nThe essence of a woman\\'s modesty is her sex. The culpable intention of the accused is\\nthe crux of the matter. The reaction of the woman is very relevant, but its absence is\\nnot always decisive. Modesty is an attribute associated with female human beings as a\\nclass. It is virtue which attaches to a family owing to her sex. The ultimate test for\\nascertaining whether the modesty of a woman has been outraged, assaulted or\\ninsulted is that the action of the offender should be such that it may be perceived as\\none which is capable of shocking the sense of decency of a woman. A person slapping\\non the posterior of a woman in full public glare would amount to outraging her modesty\\nfor it was not only an affront to the normal sense of feminine decency but also an\\naffront to the dignity of the lady. The word \"modesty\" is not to be interpreted with\\nreference to the particular victim of the act, but as an attribute associated with female\\nhuman beings as a class. It is a virtue which attaches to a female on account of her\\nsex.1006. In State of Punjab v Major Singh,1007., a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme\\nCourt considered the question — Whether modesty of a female child of seven and half\\nmonths can also be outraged. The majority view was in the aﬃrmative. Bachawat, J, on\\nbehalf of majority, opined as:\\nThe offence punishable u/s. 354 is an assault on or use of criminal force to a woman with\\nthe intention of outraging her modesty or with the knowledge of the likelihood of doing so.\\nThe Code does not deﬁne \\'modesty\\'. What then is a woman\\'s modesty? … The essence of a\\nwoman\\'s modesty is her sex. The modesty of an adult female is written large on her body.\\nYoung or old, intelligent or imbecile, awake or sleeping, the woman possesses a modesty\\ncapable of being outraged. Whoever uses criminal force to her with intent to outrage her\\nmodesty commits an offence punishable u/s. 354. The culpable intention of the accused is\\nthe crux of the matter. The reaction of the woman is very relevant, but its absence is not\\nalways decisive, as, for example, when the accused with a corrupt mind stealthily touches\\nthe ﬂesh of a sleeping woman. She may be an idiot, she may be under the spell of\\nanaesthesia, she may be sleeping, she may be unable to appreciate the signiﬁcance of the\\nact; nevertheless, the offender is punishable under the section.1008.\\nAn indecent assault upon a woman is punished under this section. Rape is punished\\nunder section 376; but the offence under this section is of less gravity than rape.1009.\\nKnowledge that modesty is likely to be outraged has been held to be suﬃcient to\\nconstitute the offence without any deliberate intention to outrage modesty. In this case\\nthe victim woman was brought into a room under false pretexts, the room was locked\\nfrom outside, inside she was forced to drink, photographs taken in naked state and\\nraped. All the participants were held to be guilty of outraging her modesty.1010. A\\nperson who is guilty of attempting rape cannot be allowed to escape with the lesser\\npenalty of this section. Where the accused walked into the room where a female child\\nof seven and a half months was sleeping and committed an indecent assault on the\\nchild, he was held to have committed an offence under this section as he had outraged\\nand intended to outrage whatever modesty the little victim was capable of.1011. Their\\nLordships of the House of Lords have pointed out that a person is guilty of indecent\\nassault if he intentionally assaults the victim and intends to commit not just an assault\\nbut an indecent assault, i.e., an assault which right-minded persons would think is\\nindecent. Accordingly, any evidence explaining the defendant\\'s conduct, whether an\\nadmission by him or otherwise, is admissible to establish whether he intended to\\ncommit an indecent assault. In this case,1012. a 26-year-old shop assistant pulled a 12-\\nyear-old girl visitor to the shop across his knees and smacked her with his hand 12\\ntimes on her bottom outside her shorts for no apparent reason. On being asked he\\nexplained his weakness as \"buttock fetish\". But for this admission there was nothing to\\nconvert the assault (to which he confessed) into an indecent one. His explanation to\\nhis secret motive was held to be relevant to hold him guilty of indecent assault.\\nMoreover, according to section 10, IPC, 1860 a woman denotes a female human being\\nof any age. Where the woman is a consenting party there cannot be any outraging of\\nmodesty.1013. Unless culpable intention is proved mere touching the belly of a female\\nin a public bus cannot be called a deliberate act of outraging the modesty of a female\\nwithin the meaning of this section. In the circumstances of the case the act of the\\naccused was held to be accidental and not intentional.1014. Where the accused caught\\nhold of a married woman and tried to open the string of her salwar with a view to\\ncommitting rape on her but being hit by the woman with a kulhari ﬂed away, it was held\\nthat he could not be convicted under section 376 read with section 511 IPC, 1860 as\\nhis action did not show a determination to have sexual intercourse at all events and in\\nspite of resistance. The conviction of the accused was accordingly changed to one\\nunder section 354, IPC, 1860.1015.\\nWhere the allegation was, while the victim was returning from home, the accused came\\nfrom behind and pressed her breast, the Court convicted him under section 354 IPC,\\ndown on the cot and sat on her chest. She shouted and after that the accused left her\\nhouse. After hearing her shouts, her cousin mother-in-law came there. High Court\\nrejected the defence of false implication and convicted the accused under section 354,\\nIPC, 1860.1017. Where a married woman alleged that the two accused persons had\\ndragged her in her own home and raped her one after the other and the medical\\nevidence showed that though there were traces of semen on her clothes, there were\\nnone on the clothes of the accused persons, the Court opined that the case was not\\nmade out; the presence of semen on the clothes of a married woman is not unusual\\nand therefore, the accused could have been prosecuted only for outraging the modesty\\nof a woman.1018.\\nSome labourers, including a woman, were taken to a police station for some work.\\nWhen they demanded wages, they were beaten up. The woman was stripped bare and\\nthrashed. The matter came before the Supreme Court in a writ petition under Article 32\\nof the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the offence under section 354, IPC,\\n1860 was established in reference to the woman and awarded compensation to be\\nrecovered from the salary of the guilty oﬃcers.1019. The offence was held to have been\\nmade out where a senior police oﬃcer slapped the posterior of the prosecutrix in the\\nmidst of guests in a party. The accused must have been fully aware that such an act\\nwould embarrass her and outrage her modesty. She made hue and cry immediately.\\nHer conduct did not suggest that she was stage-managing things to malign the\\naccused. The Court observed such behaviour was not expected from a high-ranked\\npolice oﬃcer. His conviction for the offence under the section was maintained by the\\nSupreme Court.1020.'), ('354.2', 'Parading a naked tribal woman.—\\nIn a case of parading of a naked tribal woman after disrobing her on the village road in\\nbroad daylight by appellants, the Supreme Court held that the dishonour of the victim\\ncalled for harsher punishment.1021.'), ('354.3', \"Outraging modesty or Rape.—\\nDividing line between attempt to commit rape and indecent assault is not only thin but\\nalso is practically invisible. Evidence of informant that when she went to the house of\\naccused, she found that the victim was sleeping on the ﬂoor and accused was lying on\\nher. Accused removed her nicker with a view to commit sexual intercourse. Medical\\nevidence does not indicate as to whether accused has tried to force his penis inside\\nthe private part of girl but could not succeed. Offence committed by accused did not\\namount to attempt to commit rape punishable under section 376 read with section 511\\nof IPC, 1860 but was one under section 354.1022. Though there was ample evidence\\nthat the victim was disrobed by the accused and thus the accused, outraged her\\nmodesty there was no evidence of rape. Conviction under section 376 was altered to\\nsection 354.1023. But in State of UP v Rajit Ram1024. the Supreme Court set aside a\\njudgment by which a conviction under section 376 was altered to section 354 and\\nremitted the case back to trial court. The accused in another case had forcibly laid the\\nprosecutrix on the bed and broken her pyjama's string but made no attempt to undress\\nhimself and when the prosecutrix pushed him away, he did not make efforts to grab her\\nagain. It was held that it was not an attempt to rape but only outraging of the modesty\\nof a woman and conviction under section 354 was proper.1025. But in Ram Mehar v\\nState of Haryana,1026. the accused caught hold of the prosecutrix, lifted her and then\\ntook her to a bajra ﬁeld where, he pinned her down and tried to open her salwar but\\ncould not do so as the prosecutrix had injured him by giving a sickle blow. The accused\\nfailed to give his blood sample with the result it could be presumed that his innocence\\nwas doubtful. Ocular evidence of the prosecutrix was also corroborated by other\\nevidence. It was held that conviction of the accused under sections 354, 376/511 was\\nproper. The accused caught the victim from behind, pushed her on ground, removed her\\npanty and attempted rape. Upon getting opportunity she kicked him in testicles and\\nescaped from place of occurrence. The accused was convicted under section 511 read\\nwith section 376.1027.\"), ('354.4', 'Punishment enhanced by Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 (Act\\n13 of 2013).—\\nBy the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 while no change has been made in the\\ndeﬁnition of the offence, the punishment for the offence prescribed in this section has\\nbeen changed by providing a minimum sentence of one year and a maximum sentence\\nof ﬁve years.'), ('354.5', 'CASES.—\\nWhere the allegation was that the Principal of a school misbehaved with the girl\\nstudent, the High Court declined to quash the FIR, though he was exonerated in\\nDepartmental proceedings.1028. Where the prosecutrix did not state speciﬁcally about\\nthe act, but has loosely described as \"fondling\", the Supreme Court altered the\\nconviction from section 376 to section 354.1029. Victim, a deaf and dumb girl aged 13\\nyears was lured by the accused from her house to a distant place. When family of\\nvictim reached place, the accused ﬂed away leaving victim who was weeping.

The purpose\\nand object of section 361 IPC, 1860 appears to be in dispute. In Varadarajan, the\\nSupreme Court had occasion to consider this. In section 498 IPC, 1860 we ﬁnd\\nidentical expression 'takes or entices' employed by the legislature. That was of course\\nfor a totally different offence. While considering the object of section 361 IPC, 1860,\\nthe Supreme Court in Varadarajan, took the view that the interpretation of the\\nexpression 'takes or entices' in section 498 IPC, 1860 cannot be blindly and\\nmechanically imported while considering the interpretation of the same expression in\\nsection 361 IPC, 1860. It took the view that section 498 IPC, 1860 is meant essentially\\nfor protection of the rights of the husband, whereas section 361 IPC, 1860 and other\\ncognate sections of the IPC, 1860 are intended more for the protection of minors and\\npersons of unsound mind than the rights of the guardians of such persons. But in\\nRajaram, the Supreme Court held that:\\nThe object of this section seems as much to protect the minor children from being seduced\\nfor improper purposes as to protect the rights and privileges of guardians having the lawful\\ncharge or custody of their minor wards. The gravamen of this offence lies in the taking or\\nenticing of a minor under the ages speciﬁed in this section, out of the keeping of the lawful\\nguardian without the consent of such guardian. The words 'takes or entices any minor … out\\nof the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor' in S. 361, are signiﬁcant. The use of the\\nword 'keeping' in the context connotes the idea of charge, protection, maintenance and\\ncontrol: further the guardian's charge and control appears to be compatible with the\\nindependence of action and movement in the minor, the guardian's protection and control of\\nthe minor being available, whenever necessity arises. On plain reading of this section the\\nconsent of the minor who is taken or enticed is wholly immaterial: it is only the guardian's\\nconsent which takes the case out of its purview. Nor is it necessary that the taking or\\nenticing must be shown to have been by means of force or fraud. Persuasion by the\\naccused person which creates willingness on the part of the minor to be taken out of the\\nkeeping of the lawful guardian would be suﬃcient to attract the section.\\nA person who allows such a minor who is already out of the keeping of the guardian to\\naccompany him commits no offence under section 361 IPC, 1860. That alone is the\\ndictum in Varadarajan. It is no authority on the question whether consent of a minor\\n(even a knowledgeable minor close to 18 years) is relevant or crucial in a prosecution\\nunder section 361 IPC, 1860. Later a two-Judge Bench in T D Vadgama v State of\\nGujarat,1060. ascertained the precise distinction in the dictum between the three-Judge\\nBenches in Varadarajan and Rajaram. The dictum in Varadarajan turned on its own\\npeculiar facts. It was held:\\nit would, however, be suﬃcient if the prosecution establishes that though immediately prior\\nto the minor leaving the father's protection no active part was played by the accused, he had\\nat some earlier stage solicited or persuaded the minor to do so. In our opinion, if evidence to\\nestablish one of those things is lacking, it would not be legitimate to infer that the accused\\nis guilty of taking the minor out of the keeping of the lawful guardian merely because after\\nshe has actually left her guardian's house or a house where her guardian had kept her, joined\\nthe accused and the accused helped her in her design not to return to her guardian's house\\nby taking her along with him from place to place. No doubt, the part played by the accused\\ncould be regarded as facilitating the fulﬁlment of the intention of the girl. That part, in our\\nopinion, falls short of an inducement to the minor to slip out of the keeping of her lawful\\nguardian and is, therefore, not tantamount to 'taking'.\\nThe intention with which kidnapping is effected can be ascertained from the\\ncircumstances of the offence at the time of occurrence or prior or subsequent to it. A\\nkidnapping does not per se lead to any inference of intent or purpose of\\nkidnapping.1061. Persuasion by the accused which created willingness on the part of\\nthe minor to be taken out of the keeping of the lawful guardian was held by the\\nSupreme Court to be enough to attract section 361. The Supreme Court also restated\\nthe ingredients.1062.\\nPromise of marriage made to the minor girl for leaving the house of the lawful guardian\\nwas held to be an enticement.1063.\\nThe word 'take' means 'to cause to go' to escort or to get into possession. It implies\\nwant of wish and absence of desire of the person taken. There is a distinction between\\ntaking and allowing a minor to accompany a person.1064.\"), ('361.4', \"When 'taking' is complete.—\\nThe offence of kidnapping from lawful guardianship is complete when the minor is\\nactually taken from lawful guardianship; it is not an offence continuing so long as the\\nminor is kept out of such guardianship. In determining whether a person takes a minor\\nout of the lawful keeping of its guardian, the distance to which the minor is taken away\\nis immaterial.1065.\"), ('361.5', \"'Enticing'\\nis an act of the accused by which the person kidnapped is induced of his own accord to\\ngo to the kidnapper. The word 'entice' involves an idea of inducement or allurement by\\nexciting hope or desire in the other. It may take many forms diﬃcult to visualise. It is\\nnot necessary that 'taking' or 'enticing' should be by means of force or fraud. The word\\n'entice' involves the idea of inducement or allurement.1066.\"), ('361.6', \"'Under sixteen years of age if a male, or under eighteen years of age,\\nif a female'.—\\nIn the case of a boy the age limit is ﬁxed at 16 years; in the case of a girl at 18 by Act\\nXLII of 1949. Before this amendment the age limit was 14 and 16 respectively. Where a\\ngirl under that age is kidnapped, it is no defence that the accused did not know the girl\\nto be under that age, or that from her appearance he might have thought that she was\\nof a greater age.1067. Anyone dealing with such a girl does so at his peril, and if she\\nturns out to be under 18 he must take the consequences,1068. even though he bona ﬁde\\nbelieved and had reasonable ground for believing that she was over eighteen.1069.\"), ('361.7', \"'Any person of unsound mind'.—\\nIf the person kidnapped is normally of sound mind but is made unconscious from\\npoisoning, such a person cannot be said to be of unsound mind.

The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013\\nexpanded the deﬁnition of rape and substituted new sections for old sections such as\\nsections 370, 375, 376, 376A, 376B, 376C and 376D. The Criminal Law (Amendment)\\nAct, 2013 also amended existing sections as well as created new offences in the IPC,\\n1860, such as:\\n• Public servant disobeying direction under law (section 166A)\\n• Punishment for non-treatment of victim (section 166B)\\n• Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid, etc. (section 326A)\\n• Voluntarily throwing or attempting to throw acid (section 326B)\\n• Sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment (section 354A)\\n• Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe (section 354B)\\n• Voyeurism (section 354C)\\n• Stalking (section 354D)\\n• Punishment for repeat offenders (section 376E)\\nThe altered deﬁnition increasing the age of consent to 18 is also signiﬁcant for it\\nmakes any form of penetration as set out under the section with any girl less than 18\\nyears of age to constitute rape. In a matrimonial setting, it would not have resulted in\\nrape if the woman was still less than 18 and above 15 so long as there was consent by\\nvirtue of Exception 2 contained in the section. But the decision of the Supreme Court in\\nIndependent Thought v UOI,1175. has held the provision to be unconstitutional in so far it\\nrelates to girl between ages 15 to 18. Now the Exception 2 has to be read as 'Sexual\\nintercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under\\neighteen years of age is not rape'.\\nRape is violative of victim's fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. It is\\nthe most morally and physically reprehensible crime in a society, as it is an assault on\\nthe body, mind and privacy of the victim. While a murderer destroys the physical frame\\nof the victim, a rapist degrades and deﬁles the soul of a helpless female. Rape reduces\\na woman to an animal, as it shakes the very core of her life. By no means can a rape\\nvictim be called an accomplice. Rape leaves a permanent scar on the life of the victim,\\nand therefore a rape victim is placed on a higher pedestal than an injured witness. Rape\\nis a crime against the entire society and violates the human rights of the victim. Being\\nthe most hated crime, rape tantamounts to a serious blow to the supreme honour of a\\nwoman, and offends both, her esteem and dignity. It causes psychological and physical\\nharm to the victim, leaving upon her indelible marks.1176.\"), ('375.2', 'First clause—Against her will.—In a case decided prior to the enactment of\\nthe Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013,\\nthe prosecutrix stated that ﬁrst offending act was done despite her resistance but\\nsubsequently she became a consenting party because of repeated promises of\\nmarriage. In the FIR she stated that she surrendered before him even at the time of the\\nﬁrst act because of the promises of marriage. The Court held that her version was not\\nreliable and found that the charge against the accused did not stand established.1177.'), ('375.3', 'Second clause—Without consent.—\\nIt must be said that now in a custodial rape if the girl says that she did not give\\nconsent, the Court shall presume that she did not consent1178. (vide section 114A\\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872).'), ('375.4', \"Consent on promise of marriage.—\\nConsent may be express or implied, coerced or misguided, obtained willingly or through\\ndeceit. Consent is an act of reason, accompanied by deliberation, the mind weighing,\\nas in a balance, the good and evil on each side. There is a clear distinction between\\nrape and consensual sex and the Court must very carefully examine whether the\\naccused had actually wanted to marry the victim, or had mala ﬁde motive, and had\\nmade a false promise to this effect only to satisfy his lust, as the latter falls within the\\nambit of cheating or deception. There is a distinction between the mere breach of a\\npromise, and not fulﬁlling a false promise. Thus, the Court must examine whether there\\nwas made, at an early stage a false promise of marriage by the accused; and whether\\nthe consent involved was given after wholly understanding the nature and\\nconsequences of sexual indulgence. There may be a case where the prosecutrix agrees\\nto have sexual intercourse on account of her love and passion for the accused, and not\\nsolely on account of misrepresentation made to her by the accused, or where an\\naccused on account of circumstances which he could not have foreseen, or which were\\nbeyond his control, was unable to marry her, despite having every intention to do so.\\nSuch cases must be treated differently. An accused can be convicted for rape only if\\nthe Court reaches a conclusion that the intention of the accused was mala ﬁde, and\\nthat he had clandestine motives.1179. Where a man and woman were living together,\\nsometimes at her house and sometimes at the residence of the man and when the\\nevidence suggested that it was not a case of a passive submission in the face of any\\npsychological pressure exerted and there was a tacit consent not borne out of any\\nmisconception created in her mind, complaint under this section will be untenable.1180.\\nIn the event that the accused's promise is not false and has not been made with the\\nsole intention to seduce the prosecutrix to indulge in sexual acts, such an act(s) would\\nnot amount to rape. Thus, the same would only hold that the prosecutrix, under a\\nmisconception of fact to the extent that the accused is likely to marry her, submits to\\nthe lust of the accused, such a fraudulent act cannot be said to be consensual, so far\\nas the offence of the accused is concerned.1181.\"), ('375.5', \"Consent.—Meaning.—\\nIPC, 1860 does not deﬁne consent in positive terms. But what cannot be regarded as\\nconsent is explained by section 90 which reads as 'consent given ﬁrst under fear of\\ninjury and second under a misconception of fact is not consent at all'. There are two\\ngrounds speciﬁed in section 90 which are analogous to coercion and mistake of fact.\\nThe factors set out in ﬁrst part of section 90 are from the point of view of the victim\\nand second part of section 90 enacts the corresponding provision from the point of\\nview of the accused. It envisages that the accused has knowledge or has reason to\\nbelieve that the consent was given by the victim in consequence of fear of injury or\\nmisconception of fact. Thus, the second part lays emphasis on the knowledge or\\nreasonable belief of the person who obtains the tainted consent. The requirements of\\nboth the parts should be cumulatively satisﬁed. In other words, the Court has to see\\nwhether the person giving the consent has given it under fear or misconception of fact\\nand the Court should also be satisﬁed that the person doing the act, i.e., the alleged\\noffender is conscious of the fact or should have reason to think that but for the fear or\\nmisconception, the consent would not have been given. This is the scheme of section\\n90 which is couched in negative terminology. As observed in Deelip Singh @ Dilip Kumar\\nv State of Bihar,1182. section 90 cannot be considered as an exhaustive deﬁnition of\\nconsent for the purposes of IPC, 1860. The normal connotation and concept of consent\\nis not intended to be excluded.1183. Submission of the body under the fear or terror\\ncannot be construed as a consented sexual act. Consent for the purpose of section\\n375 requires voluntary participation not only after the exercise of intelligence based on\\nthe knowledge of the signiﬁcance and moral quality of the act but after having fully\\nexercised the choice between resistance and assent. Whether there was consent or\\nnot, is to be ascertained only on a careful study of all relevant circumstances.1184. The\\nconsent does not merely mean hesitation or reluctance or a 'No' to any sexual\\nadvances but has to be an aﬃrmative one in clear terms. Consent has to be\\ncategorical, unequivocal, voluntary and could be given by words, gestures or any form\\nof verbal or non-verbal communication signifying willingness to participate in speciﬁc\\nsexual act. Woman who does not physically resist act of rape shall not by that reason\\nonly be regarded as having consented to such sexual activity. In normal parlance,\\nconsent would mean voluntary agreement of complainant to engage in sexual activity\\nwithout being abused or exploited by coercion or threats. Normal rule is that consent\\nhas to be given and it cannot be assumed.1185.\"), ('375.6', 'Section 114A of Indian Evidence Act, 1872.—\\nIndia Evidence Act, 1872 was amended by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1983 and\\nsection 114A was incorporated which imposed the burden of proving \"consent\" upon\\nthe accused in the cases of aggravated rape.

The expressions 'against her will'\\nand 'without her consent' may overlap sometimes but surely the two expressions in\\nﬁrst and second clause have different connotation and dimension. The expression\\n'against her will' would ordinarily mean that the intercourse was done by a man with a\\nwoman despite her resistance and opposition.

Rape\\non a woman under 12 years of age is now made punishable with rigorous\\nimprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 20 years, but which may extend to\\nimprisonment for life, and with ﬁne or with death. Gang rape on a woman under 12\\nyears of age is now made punishable with imprisonment for life, and with ﬁne, or with\\ndeath. Rape of girls below the age of 16 years is punishable with imprisonment of 20\\nyears or life imprisonment. The imprisonment for life shall mean imprisonment for the\\nremainder of that person's natural life. The minimum punishment for rape of girl above\\nthe age of 16 is 10 years.\\nSection 376 is not gender neutral and sexual abuse of minor boys does not come\\nwithin its purview.

Such an\\nopportunity should not, therefore, be lost on any account. Though the prosecutrix can\\nbe examined only with her consent, the accused can be subjected to such an\\nexamination by virtue of section 53 of the Cr PC, 1973. It has also to be remembered\\nthat the accused too can demand such an examination under section 54 Cr PC, 1860\\nespecially when he feels that such an examination will disprove the charge brought\\nagainst him. Thus, presence of smegma on corona glandis (glans penis) of the accused\\nsoon after the incident is proof against complete penetration since it is rubbed off\\nduring intercourse.1211. But to be of any value examination of smegma must be done\\nwithin 24 hours.1212.\\nWhere proof of sexual intercourse with the woman is itself not an issue, such as when\\nit is an admitted fact and the case rests upon issues of consent and where medical\\nexamination revealed semen stains on the vaginal swabs and salwar of the victim, the\\nCourt said that at best it is an evidence of commission of sexual intercourse but not\\nnecessarily of rape.1213.'), ('376.4', 'Two ﬁnger Test.—\\nThe two ﬁnger test and its interpretation violate the right of rape survivors to privacy,\\nphysical and mental integrity and dignity.

In view of\\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, 1966; United Nations\\nDeclaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power,\\n1985, rape survivors are entitled to legal recourse that does not re-traumatise them or\\nviolate their physical or mental integrity and dignity. They are also entitled to medical\\nprocedures conducted in a manner that respects their right to consent. Medical\\nprocedures should not be carried out in a manner that constitutes cruel, inhuman, or\\ndegrading treatment and health should be of paramount consideration while dealing\\nwith gender-based violence. The State is under an obligation to make such services\\navailable to survivors of sexual violence. Proper measures should be taken to ensure\\ntheir safety and there should be no arbitrary or unlawful interference with his\\nprivacy.1214.'), ('376.5', \"Prosecutrix not an accomplice.—\\nA prosecutrix complaining of having been a victim of an offence of rape is not an\\naccomplice after the crime. There is no rule of law that her testimony cannot be acted\\nupon without corroboration in material particulars, for the reason, that she stands on a\\nmuch higher pedestal than an injured witness.1215. A woman, who is the victim of\\nsexual assault, is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person's lust\\nand, therefore, her evidence need not be tested with the same amount of suspicion as\\nthat of an accomplice. The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 nowhere says that her evidence\\ncannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly\\na competent witness under section 118 and her evidence must receive the same\\nweight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence.1216.\"), ('376.6', \"Defence that the girl was of easy virtue.—\\nWhether the victim of rape was previously accustomed to sexual intercourse or not,\\ncannot be the determinative question. On the contrary, the question still remains as to\\nwhether the accused committed rape on the victim on the occasion complained of.\\nEven if the victim had lost her virginity earlier, it can certainly not give a licence to any\\nperson to rape her. It is the accused who was on trial and not the victim. So as to\\nwhether the victim is of a promiscuous character is totally irrelevant in a case of rape.\\nEven a woman of easy virtue has a right to refuse to submit herself to sexual\\nintercourse to anyone and everyone, because she is not a vulnerable object or prey for\\nbeing sexually assaulted by anyone and everyone. A prosecutrix stands on a higher\\npedestal than an injured witness for the reason that an injured witness gets the injury\\non the physical form, while the prosecutrix suffers psychologically and\\nemotionally.1217. In Narender Kumar v State (NCT of Delhi),1218. the Supreme Court\\ndealt with a case where the allegation was that the victim of rape herself was an\\nunchaste woman, and a woman of easy virtue. The Court discussed Rajoo v State of\\nMP,1219. and held that so far as the prosecutrix is concerned, mere statement of\\nprosecutrix herself is enough to record a conviction, when her evidence is read in its\\ntotality and found to be worthy of reliance. The incident in itself causes a great distress\\nand humiliation to the victim though, undoubtedly a false allegation of rape can cause\\nequal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused as well. The Court further held\\nthat some facts exist proving that victim was habituated to sexual intercourse, cannot\\nbe a reason to draw an inference that she was of 'loose moral character'. This cannot\\nbe a reason for her to be raped; she also has a right to protect her dignity and refuse to\\nsubmit to sexual intercourse by anyone.

It was observed\\nin Pratap Misra v State of Orissa,1223. where allegation was of rape by many persons\\nand several times, but no injury was noticed. Presence of injury in this case, certainly is\\nan important factor if the prosecutrix's version is credible, and then no corroboration\\nwould be necessary.

The Supreme Court has held that a woman\\nwho has been raped is not an accomplice. If she was ravished she is the victim of an\\noutrage and if she consented there is no rape. In the case of a girl below the age of\\nconsent, her consent will not matter so far as the offence of rape is concerned, but if\\nshe consented her evidence will be suspect as that of an accomplice. The true rule of\\nprudence requires that in every case of this type the advisability of corroboration\\nshould be present in the mind of the Judge and that must be indicated in the judgment.\\nBut corroboration can be dispensed with by the Judge if in the particular\\ncircumstances of the case before him he himself is satisﬁed that it is safe to do\\nso.1226. Indeed no rule of thumb can be laid down in this matter for every case must\\ndepend a good deal on its own peculiar facts and circumstances. Thus, in Raﬁq's\\ncase1227. Krishna Iyer, J, observed:\\nwhen no woman of honour will accuse another of rape since she sacriﬁces thereby what is\\ndearest to her, he cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist on corroborative evidence, even\\nif taken as a whole, the case spoken to by the victim strikes a judicial mind as probable …\\nWhen a woman is ravished what is inﬂicted is not merely physical injury but the deep sense\\nof some deathless shame … Judicial response to human rights cannot be blunted by legal\\nbigotry.\\nSimilarly, in Bhoginbhai's case1228. Thakkar, J, observed with some anguish:\\nIn the Indian setting refusal to act on the testimony of the victim of sexual assault in the\\nabsence of corroboration as a rule is adding insult to injury … A girl or a woman in the\\ntradition bound non-permissive society of India would be extremely reluctant even to admit\\nthat any incident which is likely to reﬂect on her chastity had ever occurred. She would be\\nconscious of the danger of being ostracised by the society … And when in the face of these\\nfactors the crime is brought to light, there is built-in assurance that the charge is genuine\\nrather than fabricated … Just as a witness who has sustained an injury (which is not shown\\nor believed to be self-inﬂicted) is the best witness in the sense that he is least likely to\\nexculpate the real offender, the evidence of a victim of sex offence is entitled to great\\nweight absence of corroboration notwithstanding.\\nRefusal by the accused person to subject himself to blood test for the purpose of\\ndetermining his fatherhood of the child who was born as a result of the alleged rape\\nwas considered to be an evidence of corroboration.1229.\"), ('376.14', 'Conviction on sole testimony of prosecutrix.—\\nA conviction on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix is sustainable where the Court is\\nconvicted of the truthfulness of the prosecutrix and there exist no circumstances which\\ncast a shadow of doubt over her veracity.1230.

The\\nroom was booked by him. He was not able to explain his whereabouts at the time of\\nthe offence. The Court further observed that the Courts have to adopt a different\\napproach in such case.

But in Suresh Kumar Koushal\\nv NAZ Foundation,1267. the Supreme Court overruled the Delhi High Court judgment\\nholding that those who indulge in carnal intercourse in the ordinary course and those\\nwho indulge in carnal intercourse against the order of nature constitute different\\nclasses and the people falling in the latter category cannot claim that section 377\\nsuffers from the vice of arbitrariness and irrational classiﬁcation. What section 377\\ndoes is merely to deﬁne the particular offence and prescribe punishment for the same\\nwhich can be awarded if in the trial conducted in accordance with the provisions of the\\nCr PC, 1973 and other statutes of the same family the person is found guilty.

The court held that so far as section\\n377 penalises any consensual sexual relationship between two adults, be it\\nhomosexuals (man and man), heterosexuals (man and woman) or lesbians (woman\\nand woman), cannot be regarded as constitutional. However, if anyone engages in any\\nkind of sexual activity with animal, said aspect of section 377 is constitutional and it\\nshall remain a penal offence. The court held that any act of description covered under\\nsection 377 done between two individuals without consent of any one of them would\\ninvite penal liability.

'Theft', has the following ingredients, namely, (i) dishonest intention to\\ntake property; (ii) the property must be movable; (ii) it should be taken out of the\\npossession of another person; (iv) it should be taken without the consent of that\\nperson; and (v) there must be some moving of the property in order to accomplish the\\ntaking of it.\\nTo bring home an offence under section 378 IPC, 1860, the prosecution is to prove (a)\\nthat there was a movable property; (b) that the said movable property was in the\\npossession of person other than the accused; (c) that the accused took it out or moved\\nit out of the possession of the said person; (d) that the accused did it dishonestly, i.e.,\\nwith intention to cause wrongful gain to himself or wrongful loss to another; (e) that the\\naccused took the movable property or moved it without the consent of the possessor\\nof the movable property.1\\nThe Criminal Court is not required to adjudicate on rival claims of title claimed by the\\nparties. All that the Criminal Court has to decide is whether at the time of the alleged\\nincident the property which is the subject-matter of theft was in the 'possession' of the\\ncomplainant and whether it was taken out of the possession of the complainant with a\\ndishonest intention.2\")]\n",

Where, therefore, the accused acting bona ﬁde in the\\ninterests of his employers ﬁnding a party of ﬁshermen poaching on his master's\\nﬁsheries, took charge of the nets and retained possession of them, pending the orders\\nof his employers, it was held that he was not guilty of theft.3 When a person seizes\\ncattle on the ground that they were trespassing on his land and causing damage to his\\ncrop or produce and gives out that he is taking them to the cattle pound, he commits\\nno offence of theft, and however mistaken he may be about his right to that land or\\ncrop. He has no dishonest intention.4 Where a respectable person just pinches the\\ncycle of another person, as his own cycle at the time was missing, and brings it back\\nand the important element of criminal intention is completely absent and he did not\\nintend by his act to cause wrongful gain to himself, it does not amount to theft.5\\nThe intention to take dishonestly must exist at the time of the moving of the property\\n[vide ill. (h)]. The taking must be dishonest. It is not necessary that the taking must\\ncause wrongful gain to the talker; it will suﬃce if it causes wrongful loss to the owner.6.\\nThus, where the accused took the complainant's three cows against her will and\\ndistributed them among her creditors, he was found guilty of stealing.7. It makes no\\ndifference in the accused's guilt that the act was not intended to procure any personal\\nbeneﬁt to him. Could it be said that a servant would not be guilty of theft if he were to\\ndeliver over his master's plate to a pressing tailor, and tell him to pay himself? If the act\\ndone was not done animo furtandi, it will not amount to theft. It is no more stealing than\\nit will be to take a stick out of a man's hand to beat him with it.8.\"), ('379.1', 'Taking need not be with intent to retain property permanently.—\\nIt is not necessary that the taking should be permanent or with an intention to\\nappropriate the thing taken9.

Where the accused took out an Indian\\nAir Force plane for an unauthorised ﬂight, even temporarily, it was held that he was\\nguilty of theft.10. It would satisfy the deﬁnition of theft if the accused takes away any\\nmovable property out of the possession of another person though he intended to return\\nit later on. The accused, who was working in a Government oﬃce, removed a ﬁle to his\\nhouse, made it available to an outsider and then returned it to the oﬃce after two days.\\nIt was held by the Supreme Court that the accused was guilty of theft.11.'), ('379.2', \"Bona ﬁde dispute.—\\nWhere property is removed in the assertion of a contested claim of right, however ill-\\nfounded that claim may be, the removal thereof does not constitute theft.12.

The\\ndispute as to ownership must be bona ﬁde. A mere colourable pretence to obtain or\\nkeep possession of property does not avail as a defence.14. It is not theft if a person,\\nacting under a mistaken notion of law, and believing that certain property is his, and\\nthat he has the right to take the same, until payment of the balance of some money due\\nto him from the vendor, removes such property from the possession of the vendee.15.\\nWhere a bona ﬁde claim of right exists, it can be a good defence to a prosecution for\\ntheft. Thus where the question of possession was in a ﬂuid state and the accused bona\\nﬁde believed that the crop was his as he had cultivated the land, no offence either of\\ncriminal trespass or theft could be made out against him. Such a matter is better\\ndecided in a Civil Court.16. However, it was held in a case of dacoity that the question\\nof bona ﬁde claim of right arises only where the accused show to the Court's\\nsatisfaction that their belief is reasonable and is based on some documents and title,\\nhowever weak it may be.17.

On a plain reading of these provisions, it is clear\\nthat to constitute an offence of \\'dacoity\\', robbery essentially should be committed by\\nﬁve or more persons. Similarly, to constitute an offence of \\'dacoity with murder\\' any one\\nof the ﬁve or more persons should commit a murder while committing the dacoity, then\\nevery one of such persons so committing, attempting to commit or aiding, by ﬁction of\\nlaw, would be deemed to have committed the offence of murder and be liable for\\npunishment provided under these provisions depending upon the facts and\\ncircumstances of the case.153.\\nDacoity is perhaps the only offence which the Legislature has made punishable at four\\nstages. When ﬁve or more persons assemble for the purpose of committing a dacoity,\\neach of them is punishable under section 402 merely on the ground of joining the\\nassembly. Another stage is that of preparation and if any one makes preparation to\\ncommit a dacoity, he is punishable under section 399. The deﬁnition of \\'dacoity\\' in this\\nsection shows that the other two stages, namely, the stage of attempting to commit\\nand the stage of actual commission of robbery, have been treated alike, and come\\nwithin the deﬁnition.154. In other words, attempt to commit dacoity is also dacoity.\\n\"It will, therefore, be seen that it is possible to commit the offence of dacoity under\\nsection 395, IPC, 1860, by merely attempting to commit a robbery by ﬁve or more\\npersons without being successful in getting any booty whatsoever. Thus, if in a\\nparticular case the dacoits are forced to retreat due to stiff opposition from the\\ninmates or villagers without collecting any booty, then it must be held that the offence\\nof dacoity is completed the moment the dacoits take to their heels without any\\nbooty\".155. Even in such a case all the dacoits can be convicted and punished under\\nsection 395, IPC, 1860.156.\\nIn a case of dacoity the circumstance that the inmates of the house, seeing the large\\nnumber of dacoits, do not offer any resistance and no force or violence is required or\\nused does not reduce the dacoity to theft.157.'), ('391.1', \"'Conjointly'.—\\nThis word manifestly refers to united or concerted action of the persons participating\\nin the transaction. It is only when their individual action can be properly referred to their\\nconcerted action that the question of conviction under this section can arise.158. When\\nthere is doubt as to how many persons are involved in commission of offence and the\\naccused/appellants were not identiﬁed during Test Identiﬁcation Parade, they are\\nentitled to beneﬁt of doubt.159.\"), ('391.2', 'Five or more persons.—\\nInterpretation of section 391 IPC, 1860 is simple, that there must be at least ﬁve\\npersons in a dacoity; the section nowhere says that minimum ﬁve persons must be\\nconvicted of it.160.'), ('391.3', 'CASES.—\\nWhere the allegation was that on the day of incident, victim was travelling on scooter\\nwith cash, two scooter borne accused armed with sword, knife, club and pistol stopped\\nvictim, asked him to leave scooter and get away and then accused with their\\naccomplices ﬂed away with scooter, accused were acquitted on the ground that test\\nidentiﬁcation parade was conducted after 46 days of arrest of alleged accused.161.\\nThe accused persons took away gold ornaments and service revolver of the victim.\\nThey were apprehended and, on the basis of their statements, stolen articles were\\nrecovered. Identiﬁcation of the accused persons and the articles was made by the\\nvictim at TI parade. The conviction of the accused person was held to be proper.162.\\nWhere there were only ﬁve named accused who committed the dacoity and out of ﬁve\\ntwo were acquitted holding that only three took part in the offence, it was held that the\\nremaining three could not be convicted of dacoity, as the offence of dacoity could not\\nbe committed by less than ﬁve persons.163. Where in spite of the acquittal of a number\\nof persons, it is found as a fact that along with the persons convicted there were other\\nunidentiﬁed persons who participated in the offence, bringing the total number of\\nparticipants to ﬁve or more, it was held that the conviction of the identiﬁed persons,\\nthough less than ﬁve, was perfectly correct.164.

Where in the course of a dacoity one man was shot dead,\\nand the accused person who was tried had a gun and others of the dacoits also had\\nguns, and there was no evidence that the accused was the man who ﬁred the fatal\\nshot, the sentence was altered from one of death to one of transportation for life.194.'), ('396.1', 'Ingredients.—\\nThe offence under this section requires two things:—\\n(1) The dacoity must be the joint act of the persons concerned.\\n(2) Murder must have been committed in the course of the commission of the\\ndacoity.195.\\nSection 391 IPC, 1860 explains the offence of \\'dacoity\\'. When ﬁve or more persons\\nconjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery, or where the whole number of\\npersons conjointly committing or attempting to commit a robbery, and persons present\\nand aiding such commission and attempt amount to ﬁve or more, every person so\\ncommitting, attempting or aiding, is said to commit \\'dacoity\\'. Under section 392 IPC,\\n1860, the offence of \\'robbery\\' simpliciter is punishable with rigorous imprisonment\\nwhich may extend to ten years or 14 years depending upon the facts of a given case.\\nSection 396 IPC, 1860 brings within its ambit a murder committed along with \\'dacoity\\'.\\nIn terms of this provision, if any one of the ﬁve or more persons, who are conjointly\\ncommitting dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those\\npersons shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life or rigorous\\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to\\nﬁne.196. In the ﬁrst instance, what is to be examined is whether the basic ingredient of\\nthe offence falling under sections 395, 396 and 397 of IPC, 1860, namely, participation\\nof ﬁve or more persons was made out.197. On a plain reading of these provisions, it is\\nclear that to constitute an offence of \\'dacoity\\', robbery essentially should be committed\\nby ﬁve or more persons. Similarly, to constitute an offence of \\'dacoity with murder\\' any\\none of the ﬁve or more persons should commit a murder while committing the dacoity,\\nthen every one of such persons so committing, attempting to commit or aiding, by\\nﬁction of law, would be deemed to have committed the offence of murder and be liable\\nfor punishment provided under these provisions depending upon the facts and\\ncircumstances of the case.198.\\nFor recording conviction for dacoity, there must be ﬁve or more persons. In the absence\\nof such ﬁnding, an accused cannot be convicted for dacoity. In a given case, however, it\\nmay happen that there may be ﬁve or more persons and the factum of ﬁve or more\\npersons is either not disputed or is clearly established, but the Court may not be able to\\nrecord a ﬁnding as to identity of all the persons said to have committed the dacoity and\\nmay not be able to convict them and order their acquittal observing that their identity is\\nnot established. In such case, conviction of less than ﬁve persons—or even one—can\\nstand. But in the absence of such ﬁnding, less than ﬁve persons cannot be convicted\\nfor dacoity. A similar situation arises in dealing with cases of \"unlawful assembly\" as\\ndeﬁned in section 141 IPC, 1860 and liability of every member of such unlawful\\nassembly for an offence committed in prosecution of common object under section\\n149 IPC, 1860. In this case there were six accused. Out of those six accused, two were\\nacquitted by the trial Court without recording a ﬁnding that though offence of dacoity\\nwas committed by six persons, identity of two accused could not be established. They\\nwere simply acquitted by the Court. Therefore, as per settled law, four persons could\\nnot be convicted for dacoity, being less than ﬁve which is an essential ingredient for\\ncommission of dacoity. Moreover, all of them were acquitted for an offence of criminal\\nconspiracy punishable under section 120-B IPC, 1860 as also for receiving stolen\\nproperty in the commission of dacoity punishable under section 412 IPC, 1860. The\\nconviction of the appellant in this case for an offence punishable under section 396\\nIPC, 1860, therefore, could not stand and must be set aside.199.'), ('396.2', 'Presence of all not necessary.—\\nThe section says that if \"any one of ﬁve or more persons, who are conjointly\\ncommitting dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity\" then every one of those\\npersons shall be liable to the penalty prescribed in the section. It is not necessary that\\nmurder should be committed in the presence of all. When in the commission of a\\ndacoity a murder is committed, it matters not whether the particular dacoit was inside\\nthe house where the dacoity is committed, or outside the house, or whether the murder\\nwas committed inside or outside the house, so long only as the murder was committed\\nin the commission of that dacoity.200. The essence of an offence under this section is\\nmurder committed in commission of dacoity. It does not matter whether murder is\\ncommitted in the immediate presence of a particular person or persons. It is not even\\nnecessary that murder should have been within the previous contemplation of the\\nperpetrators of the crime.201. But in a case the dacoits were forced to retreat without\\ncollecting any booty, the offence of dacoity would be completed as soon as they left\\nthe house of occurrence and took to their heels. And if a murder was committed by any\\none of the dacoits in course of such a retreat without any booty, then only the actual\\nmurderer will be liable under section 302, IPC, 1860, and conjoint responsibility under\\nsection 396, IPC, 1860, could not be ﬁxed on others though all of them could be\\nconvicted under section 395, IPC, 1860 as attempt to commit dacoity is also\\ndacoity.202.'), ('396.3', 'Number of Persons.—\\nConviction for an offence of dacoity of less than ﬁve persons is not sustainable.203. For\\nrecording conviction, there must be ﬁve or more persons. In absence of such ﬁnding,\\nan accused cannot be convicted for an offence of dacoity. In a given case, however, it\\nmay happen that there may be ﬁve or more persons and the factum of ﬁve or more\\npersons is either not disputed or is clearly established, but the Court may not be able to\\nrecord a ﬁnding as to identity of all the persons said to have committed dacoity and\\nmay not be able to convict them and order their acquittal observing that their identity is\\nnot established. In such case, conviction of less than ﬁve persons — or even one can\\nstand. But in absence of such ﬁnding, less than ﬁve persons cannot be convicted for an\\noffence of dacoity.204.'), ('396.4', 'Presumption from recent possession.—\\nSimply on the recovery of stolen articles, no inference can be drawn that a person in\\npossession of the stolen articles is guilty of the offence of murder and robbery.205. The\\nnature of the presumption under Illustration (a) of section 114 of the Indian Evidence\\nAct, 1872 must depend upon the nature of evidence adduced. No ﬁxed time-limit can\\nbe laid down to determine whether possession is recent or otherwise. Each case must\\nbe judged on its own facts. The question as to what amounts to recent possession\\nsuﬃcient to justify the presumption of guilt varies according \"as the stolen article is or\\nis not calculated to pass readily from hand to hand\". If the stolen articles were such as\\nwere not likely to pass readily from hand to hand, the period of one year that elapsed\\ncould not be said to be too long particularly when the appellant had been absconding\\nduring that period.206.'), ('396.5', \"Section 396 and Section 302.—\\nThe ingredients of both these offences, to some extent, are also different in as much as\\nto complete an offence of 'dacoity' under section 396 IPC, 1860, ﬁve or more persons\\nmust conjointly commit the robbery while under section 302 of the IPC, 1860 even one\\nperson by himself can commit the offence of murder. But, as already noticed, to attract\\nthe provisions of section 396, the offence of 'dacoity' must be coupled with murder. In\\nother words, the ingredients of section 302 become an integral part of the offences\\npunishable under section 396 of the IPC, 1860. Resultantly, the distinction with regard\\nto the number of persons involved in the commission of the crime loses its\\nsigniﬁcance as it is possible that the offence of 'dacoity' may not be proved but still the\\noffence of murder could be established, like in the present case. Upon reasonable\\nanalysis of the language of these provisions, it is clear that the Court has to keep in\\nmind the ingredients which shall constitute a criminal offence within the meaning of\\nthe penal section. This is not only essential in the case of the offence charged with but\\neven where there is comparative study of different penal provisions as the accused\\nmay have committed more than one offence or even offences of a graver nature. He\\nmay ﬁnally be punished for a lesser offence or vice versa, if the law so permits and the\\nrequisite ingredients are satisﬁed.207. On the conjoint reading of sections 396 and 302\\nIPC, 1860, it is clear that the offence of murder has been lifted and incorporated in the\\nprovisions of section 396 IPC, 1860. In other words, the offence of murder punishable\\nunder section 302 and as deﬁned under section 300 will have to be read into the\\nprovisions of offences stated under section 396 IPC, 1860. In other words, where a\\nprovision is physically lifted and made part of another provision, it shall fall within the\\nambit and scope of principle akin to 'legislation by incorporation' which normally is\\n1956).\\nSC 912 : 1988 Supp SCC 152 . Where all the ingredients were established and the conviction\\napplied between an existing statute and a newly enacted law. The expression 'murder'\\nappearing in section 396 would have to take necessarily in its ambit and scope the\\ningredients of section 300 of the IPC, 1860. The provisions are clear and admit no\\nscope for application of any other principle of interpretation except the 'golden rule of\\nconstruction', i.e., to read the statutory language grammatically and terminologically in\\nthe ordinary and primary sense which it appears in its context without omission or\\naddition. These provisions read collectively, put the matter beyond ambiguity that the\\noffence of murder, is by speciﬁc language, included in the offences under section 396.\\nIt will have the same connotation, meaning and ingredients as are contemplated under\\nthe provisions of section 302 IPC, 1860.208.\"), ('396.6', \"Charge under section 396.—Conviction under section 302.—\\nNo prejudice has been caused to the appellant by his conviction for an offence under\\nsection 302 IPC, 1860 though he was initially charged with an offence punishable under\\nsection 396 IPC, 1860 read with section 201 IPC, 1860. The circumstances which\\nconstitute an offence under section 302 were literally put to him, as section 302 IPC,\\n1860 itself is an integral part of an offence punishable under section 396 IPC, 1860.\\nOnce the appellant has not suffered any prejudice, much less a serious prejudice, then\\nthe conviction of the appellant under section 302 IPC, 1860 cannot be set aside merely\\nfor want of framing of a speciﬁc/ alternate charge for an offence punishable under\\nsection 302 IPC, 1860. It is more so because the dimensions and facets of an offence\\nunder section 302 are incorporated by speciﬁc language and are inbuilt in the offence\\npunishable under section 396 IPC, 1860.

There can be cases where there may be an assembly for the\\npurpose of dacoity without even a fringe of preparation. The mere fact that the\\nappellants are acquitted of the charge under section 399 is no ground to knock off the\\ncharge under section 402, IPC, 1860.242. In order to establish an offence punishable\\nunder section 399, IPC, 1860 some act amounting to preparation must be proved and\\nwhat must be proved further is an act for which preparation was being made was a\\ndacoity, that is to say, robbery to be committed by ﬁve or more persons. The\\nprosecution has to establish under section 402, IPC, 1860 that there had been an\\nassembly of ﬁve or more persons constituted for the purpose of committing dacoity\\nand that the accused persons were members of that assembly.

Attempt to commit an offence can be said to begin\\nwhen the preparations are complete and the culprit commences to do something with\\nthe intention of committing the offence and which is a step towards the commission of\\nthe offence. The moment he commences to do an act with the necessary Intention, he\\ncommences his attempt to commit the offence. The word \"attempt\" is not itself\\ndeﬁned, and must, therefore, be taken in its ordinary meaning. This is exactly what the\\nprovisions of section 511 require. An attempt to commit a crime is to be distinguished\\nfrom an intention to commit it and from preparation made for its commission. Mere\\nintention to commit an offence, not followed by any act, cannot constitute an offence.\\nThe will is not be taken for the deed unless there be some external act which shows\\nthat progress, has been made in the direction of it, or towards maturing and effecting it.\\nIntention is the direction of conduct towards the object chosen upon considering the\\nmotives which suggest the choice. Preparation consists in devising or arranging the\\nmeans or measures necessary for the commission of the offence. It differs widely from\\nattempt which is the direct movement towards the commission after preparations are\\nmade. Preparation to commit an offence is punishable only when the preparation is to\\ncommit offences under section 122 (waging war against the Government of India) and\\nsection 399 (preparation to commit dacoity).

It provides that \"whoever dishonestly misappropriates or\\nconverts to his own use any movable property\", shall be punished with imprisonment of\\neither description for a term which may extend to two years or with ﬁne or both. The\\nbasic requirement for attracting the section is: (i) the movable property in question\\nshould belong to a person other than the accused; (ii) the accused should wrongly\\nappropriate or convert such property to his own use; and (iii) there should be dishonest\\nintention on the part of the accused. Here again the basic requirement is that the\\nsubject matter of dishonest misappropriation or conversion should be someone else\\'s\\nmovable property.

Two distinct parts are\\ninvolved in the commission of the offence of criminal breach of trust. The ﬁrst part\\nconsists of the creation of an obligation in relation to the property over which dominion\\nor control is acquired by the accused. The second is the misappropriation or dealing\\nwith the property dishonestly and contrary to the terms of the obligation created.283. A\\ntrust contemplated by section 405 would arise only when there is an entrustment of\\nproperty or dominion over property. There has, therefore, to be a property belonging to\\nsomeone which is entrusted to the person accused of the offence under section 405.\\nThe entrustment of property creates a trust which is only an obligation annexed to the\\nownership of the property and arises out of a conﬁdence reposed and accepted by the\\nowner.284. However, it must be borne in mind that section 405 IPC, 1860 does not\\ncontemplate the creation of a trust with all the technicalities of the law of trust. It\\ncontemplates the creation of a relationship whereby the owner of property makes it\\nover to another person to be retained by him until a certain contingency arises or to be\\ndisposed of by him on the happening of a certain event.285.\\n461] : AIR 2012 SC 3242 [LNIND 2012 SC 461] ; Asoke Basak v State of Maharashtra, (2010) 10\\nSCC 660 [LNIND 2010 SC 1699] : (2011) 1 SCC(Cr) 85; Indian Oil Corpn. v NEPC India Ltd, (2006)\\n6 SCC 736 [LNIND 2006 SC 537] ; Pratibha Rani v Suraj Kumar, (1985) 2 SCC 370 [LNIND 1985\\nSC 86] ; Rashmi Kumar v Mahesh Kumar Bhada, (1997) 2 SCC 397 [LNIND 1996 SC 2178] ; R\\nVenkatkrishnan v Central Bureau of Investigation, (2009) 11 SCC 737 [LNIND 2009 SC 1653] .\\n1 SCC (Cr) 507.\\nSCC (Cr) 1290; Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney v State of Bombay, AIR 1956 SC 575 [LNIND 1956 SC\\n40] : 1956 Cr LJ 1116 .')]\n",

      "[('406', 'Punishment for criminal breach of trust.\\nWhoever commits criminal breach of trust shall be punished with imprisonment of\\neither description for a term which may extend to three years, or with ﬁne, or with\\nboth.\\nCOMMENT—\\nThe criminal breach of trust would, inter alia, mean using or disposing of the property\\nby a person who is entrusted with or has otherwise dominion there over. Such an act\\nmust not only be done dishonestly but also in violation of any direction of law or any\\ncontract express or implied relating to carrying out the trust.286. To constitute this\\noffence there must be dishonest misappropriation by a person in whom conﬁdence is\\nplaced as to the custody or management of the property in respect of which the breach\\nof trust is charged. The ownership or beneﬁcial interest in the property in respect of\\nwhich criminal breach of trust is alleged to have been committed must be in some\\nperson other than the accused and the latter must hold it on account of some person\\nor in some way for his beneﬁt.287. The offence of criminal breach of trust closely\\nresembles the offence of embezzlement under the English law. Offences committed by\\ntrustees with regard to trust property fall within the purview of this section.\\nA partner has undeﬁned ownership along with other partners over all the assets of the\\npartnership. If he chooses to use any of them for his own purpose he may be\\naccountable civilly to other partners. But he does not thereby commit any\\nmisappropriation. A partner may have dominion over the partnership property. But\\nmere dominion is not enough. It must further be shown that his dominion was the\\nresult of entrustment. Thus to prosecute a partner the prosecution must establish that\\ndominion over the assets or a particular asset of the partnership was by a special\\nagreement between the parties, entrusted to the accused partner. If in the absence of\\nsuch a special agreement a partner receives money belonging to the partnership he\\ncannot be said to have received it in a ﬁduciary capacity or in other words cannot be\\nheld to have been entrusted with dominion over partnership properties and without\\nentrustment there cannot be any criminal breach of trust.288. The Supreme Court has\\nreiterated that where a partner is entrusted with property under special contract and he\\nholds that property in a ﬁduciary capacity, any misappropriation of that property would\\namount to criminal breach of trust.289.'), ('406.1', 'Ingredients.—\\nThe section requires—\\n(1) Entrusting any person with property or with any dominion over property;\\n(2) The person entrusted (a) dishonestly misappropriating or converting to his own\\nuse that property; or\\n(b) Dishonestly using or disposing of that property or wilfully suffering any other\\nperson so to do in violation\\n(i) of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be\\ndischarged, or\\n(ii) of any legal contract made touching the discharge of such trust.\\nThis offence consists of any one of four positive acts, namely, misappropriation,\\nconversion, user, or disposal of property. Neither failure to account for breach of\\ncontract, however dishonest, is actually and by itself the offence of criminal breach of\\ntrust.290.\\nSufferance of any loss by the victim is not necessary for leading to a conviction under\\nthe section.291.\\nThe section does not require that the trust should be in furtherance of any lawful\\nobject. Offences committed by trustees with regard to trust property fall within the\\npurview of this section. Negligence or other misconduct causing the loss of trust\\nproperty may make the person entrusted civilly responsible, but will not make him\\nguilty of criminal breach of trust.'), ('406.2', 'Criminal misappropriation and criminal breach of trust.—\\nIn criminal misappropriation the property comes into the possession of the offender by\\nsome casualty or otherwise, and he afterwards misappropriates it. In the case of\\ncriminal breach of trust the offender is lawfully entrusted with the property, and he\\ndishonestly misappropriates the same, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do,\\ninstead of discharging the trust attached to it.\\nenlarge the term \"entrustment\" itself and, unless there is entrustment, the transaction in\\nquestion cannot be affected by the terms of that section.292. The word \\'entrusted\\' is\\nnot a term of law. In its most general signiﬁcance all it imports is a handing over of the\\npossession for some purpose which may not imply the conferring of any proprietary\\nright at all.293. The natural meaning of \\'entrusted\\' involves that the assured should by\\nsome real and conscious volition have imposed on the person, to whom he delivers the\\ngoods, some species of ﬁduciary duty.294. The expression \"entrustment\" carries with it\\nthe implication that the person handing over any property or on whose behalf that\\nproperty is handed over to another, continues to be its owner. Further, the person\\nhanding over property must have conﬁdence in the person taking the property so as to\\ncreate a ﬁduciary relationship between them.295.\\nOnce entrustment is proved, the prosecution has not to prove any misappropriation. It\\nis for the accused to prove in his defence that there was no misappropriation. The\\noffence becomes proved when it is shown that the money has not been applied to the\\npurpose for which it was entrusted.296.'), ('406.3', \"Customary gifts at engagement, etc.—\\nGifts in cash or kind which are customarily given at the time of engagement, tilak or\\nmarriage ceremony cannot be regarded as an entrustment of items of dowry. No\\ncomplaint can be presented against the donee in respect of such customary\\npractices.297.\\nWhere a person authorised to collect, delegates his functions to a subordinate of his,\\nand the latter acts in exercise of such delegated authority, any amount that is paid to\\nhim would constitute 'entrustment' within the meaning of section 405.298.\"), ('406.4', \"'Property'.—\\nThe word 'property' is used in the Code in a much wider sense than the expression\\n'movable property'. There is no good reason to restrict the meaning of the word\\n'property' to movable property only when it is used without any qualiﬁcation in this\\nsection or other sections of the Penal Code.299. The offence of criminal breach of trust\\nis committed not only by dishonest conversion, but also by dishonest use or\\ndisposition, and there is nothing in the wording of this section to exempt from the\\ndeﬁnition of criminal breach of trust dishonest use of immovable property by the\\nperson entrusted with dominion over it.\\nIn cases of criminal breach of trust a distinction has to be drawn between the person\\nentrusted with property and one having control or general charge over the property. In\\ncase of the former, if it is found that the property is missing, without further proof, the\\nperson so entrusted will be liable to account for it. In the latter case, that person will be\\nliable only when it is shown that he misappropriated it or was a party to criminal breach\\nof trust committed in respect of that property by any other person.300.\\ncriminal breach of trust. The bank oﬃcials in this case made public money available to\\na private party contrary to statutory provisions and Departmental instructions. The\\ndishonest intention was self-evident.301. Terms of section 405 are very wide. They\\napply to one who is in any manner entrusted with property or dominion over property.\\nSection 405 does not require that trust should be in furtherance of any lawful object. It\\nmerely provides that a person commits criminal breach of trust if he dishonestly\\nmisappropriates or converts to his own use the property entrusted to him.302.\"), ('406.5', \"Negligence is not 'Dishonestly'.—\\nCriminal or dishonest intention is a sine qua non in an offence of criminal breach of\\ntrust. This being so the prosecution has to show that the accused dishonestly\\nmisappropriated or converted to his own use or dishonestly disposed of property\\nentrusted to him. The prosecution must prove 'entrustment' or 'domino' over the\\nproperty with the person proceeded and the person so entrusted has dishonestly\\nmisappropriated or converted that property. Even if the prosecution succeeds in\\nproving entrustment, it would fail to establish the offence against the accused, if it fails\\nto prove that he has misappropriated the property entrusted303.\\nIt has been held that a mere error of judgment does not attract criminal liability.304.\"), ('406.6', 'Wilful omission to account.—\\nSimilarly, \"in the case of a servant charged with misappropriating the goods of his\\nmaster the elements of criminal offence of misappropriation will be established if the\\nprosecution proves that the servant received the goods, that he was under a duty to\\naccount to his master and had not done so. If the failure to account was due to an\\naccidental loss the facts being within the servant\\'s knowledge, it is, for him to explain\\nthe loss\".305. In JM Desai\\'s case the matter was further clariﬁed by the Supreme Court\\nto say, \"conviction of a person for the offence of criminal breach of trust may not in all\\ncases be founded merely on his failure to account for the property entrusted to him, or\\nover which he has dominion, even when a duty to account is imposed upon him, but\\nwhere he is unable to account or renders an explanation for his failure to account\\nwhich is untrue an inference of misappropriation with dishonest intent may readily be\\nmade\".306.\\nMere retention of goods by a person without misappropriation does not constitute\\ncriminal breach of trust.307.\\ncriminal breach of trust punishable under section 406 of the IPC, 1860, there must be\\ndishonest misappropriation by a person in whom conﬁdence is placed as to the\\ncustody or management of the property in respect of which the breach of trust is\\ncharged. The misappropriation or conversion or disposal must be with a dishonest\\nintention. Every breach of trust gives rise to a suit for damages, but it is only when there\\nis evidence of a mental act of fraudulent misappropriation that the commission of\\nembezzlement of any sum of money becomes a penal offence punishable as criminal\\nbreach of trust. It is this mental act of fraudulent misappropriation that clearly\\ndemarcates an act of embezzlement which is a civil wrong or tort, from the offence of\\ncriminal breach of trust. In the present case, apparently the prosecution has failed to\\nestablish the offence of cheating and criminal breach of trust in the absence of mens\\nrea. In such view of the matter, the accused persons could not have been convicted.308.\\n3A. In violation of any direction of law.—The criminal breach of trust would, inter alia,\\nmean using or disposing of the property by a person who is entrusted with or has\\notherwise dominion there over. Such an act must not only be done dishonestly but also\\nin violation of any direction of law or any contract express or implied relating to\\ncarrying out the trust. A direction of law need not be a law made by the Parliament or a\\nLegislature; it may be made by an authority having the power therefor; the law could be\\na subordinate legislation, a notiﬁcation or even a custom.309. It has been held that the\\nexpression \"direction of law\", even if taken literally, would include a direction issued by\\nauthorities in exercise of their statutory power as also power of supervision. Failure on\\nthe part of bank oﬃcials to follow RBI instructions and provisions of a Departmental\\nManual was a violation of a direction of law amounting to criminal breach of trust. The\\nManual was the UCO Bank Manual of Instructions on Bill Discounting.310.\\nIt has been held that the expression \"direction of law\" in section 405 includes banking\\nnorms, practices and directions given in internal Departmental instructions of a bank.\\nBank oﬃcials who allowed advance credits on banker\\'s cheques to a customer in\\nviolation of Departmental instructions acted in violation of direction of law. The\\noﬃcials had dominion over the money belonging to the bank and they dishonestly used\\nthat money for conferring a beneﬁt on the customer. They were held guilty of the\\noffence under the section.311.'), ('406.7', 'Partner.—\\nIn Velji Raghavji,312. the Supreme Court approved this statement of law in Bhuban\\nMohanRana v Surendra Mohan Das, and held that mere existence of the accused\\'s\\ndominion over property is not enough and that it must be further shown that his\\ndominion was the result of entrustment. According to the Supreme Court the\\nprosecution must establish that dominion over the assets or a particular asset of the\\npartnership was by a special agreement between the parties, entrusted to the accused\\npartner. Where the partner of a ﬁrm had taken away some VCRs and cassettes, a\\ncriminal complaint was not allowed, the loss to the ﬁrm being essentially of civil nature\\nand, therefore, civil proceedings would have been more appropriate.313. Signing of\\ncontracts on behalf of the ﬁrm particularly when the partnership deed authorised\\npartners to sign documents on behalf of others was held to be not constituting a\\ncriminal breach of trust.314. As to when can a partner be prosecuted on a charge of\\ncriminal breach of trust see \"Comments\" ante.'), ('406.8', 'Misappropriation of company money by nominated director.—\\nThe accused was the director of a public limited company and in that capacity he\\nmisappropriated a huge sum of money. In the complaint against him the charge was\\nmade out under section 409. However, the charge was framed under section 408. It\\nwas held that the accused was a nominated director of the company and there was\\nnothing to indicate that he was an employee or servant of the company. Hence, his\\nconviction under section 408 was not to be legally sound. He was convicted under\\nsection 406.315.'), ('406.9', \"Directors of company.—\\nThe directors of a company were prosecuted for non-deposit of PF amount of\\nemployees.

Where the wife was turned out of the house by the\\nhusband who refused to return the 'streedhan' despite repeated requests and\\npersuasions, it was held that criminal breach of trust is a continuing offence and fresh\\ncause of action accrues to the wife till the return of the property.320.\\nIt has been held that taking away by the mother-in-law of gifts and cash offerings to the\\nwife at the time of her marriage amounts to misappropriation of streedhan.

When dispute\\nbetween the parties constitute only a civil wrong and not a criminal wrong, the Courts\\nwould not permit a person to be harassed although no case for taking cognizance of\\nthe offence has been made out336. An act of breach of trust simpliciter involves a civil\\nwrong of which the person wronged may seek his redress for damages in a civil Court\\nbut a breach of trust with mens rea gives rise to a criminal prosecution as well. The\\nelement of 'dishonest intention' is therefore, an essential element to constitute the\\noffence of Criminal Breach of Trust.337. Breach of trust may be basically a civil wrong,\\nbut it gives rise to criminal liability also when there is mens rea.338. The difference\\nbetween the two lies in dishonest intention.339.

What amounts to criminal breach of trust is\\nprovided under section 405, IPC, 1860. The basic requirement to bring home the\\naccusations under section 405 are the requirements to prove conjointly (i) entrustment\\nand (ii) whether the accused was actuated by dishonest intention or not,\\nmisappropriated it or converted it to his own use to the detriment of the persons who\\nentrusted it.368.\\nMerely because the accused allegedly kept the amount in deﬁance of the oﬃcial\\ninstruction, it cannot be an incriminating circumstance to arrive at a conclusion that he\\nhas committed the breach of trust. It is a settled position of law that suspicion\\nhowsoever grave cannot take the place of proof.369.\\nThe section cannot be construed as implying that any head of an oﬃce that is\\nnegligent in seeing that the rules about remitting money to the treasury are observed is\\nipso facto guilty of criminal breach of trust; but something more than that is required to\\nbring home the dishonest intention. There should be some indication which justiﬁes a\\nﬁnding that the accused deﬁnitely had the intention of wrongfully keeping Government\\nout of the moneys.370.

Where a post-master misappropriated the money entrusted to him but paid\\nback the whole amount before being challenged, his acquittal on this ground was held\\nto be wrong.374. But the Courts do take that fact into account as a mitigating factor\\nand would consider light punishment as suﬃcient to meet the ends of justice.375.\\nWhere certain articles disappeared from an open godown which was being watched by\\na Chowkidar (watchman), it was held that the over-all incharge overseer could not be\\nheld liable under the section unless there was the proof that the articles disappeared\\nbecause of his doings or non-doings.376.\\nThe offence under the section requires criminal intent or mens rea. Where in the matter\\nof post oﬃce deposit accounts, all that was proved showed that there was negligence\\nin maintaining them, the Court said that it could be a ﬁt case for departmental\\nproceedings but not proceedings under section 409 because the intention to\\nmisappropriate the proceeds of the accounts was not in evidence.377.'), ('409.2', 'Property of Government company.—\\nThe property of a Government company was purchased by a ﬁrm of which the accused\\nwas a partner.

An Assistant Engineer was\\ncharged for criminal breach of trust for misappropriating Govt. Funds. It was found that\\nthere was no entrustment of funds to the accused public servant.

It should, however, be\\nremembered that the prosecution has to prove that the public servant has acted\\ndishonestly in regard to property entrusted to him.425.'), ('409.17', 'Section 420 and 409.—Distinction.—\\nIn \\'criminal breach of trust\\', an accused comes into possession of a property or\\nacquires dominion over a property honestly and bona ﬁde, but he develops dishonest\\nintention subsequent to the taking possession of, or subsequent to having acquired the\\ndominion over, the property and, having developed such dishonest intention, he\\ndishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use the property or dishonestly\\nuses or disposes of the property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the\\nmode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or\\nimplied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any\\nother person so to do. Thus, in \\'criminal breach of trust\\', the intention of the accused\\ncannot be dishonest or mala ﬁde at the time, when he comes into possession of the\\nproperty or comes to acquire dominion over the property; but, having come into\\npossession of, or having acquired dominion over, the property, the accused develops\\ndishonest intention and actuated by such mens rea, he converts to his own use the\\nproperty or dishonestly uses or disposes of the property in violation of any direction of\\nlaw prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal\\ncontract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust,\\nor wilfully suffers any other person so to do. Contrary to what happens in \"criminal\\nbreach of trust\", the intention of the accused, in a case or \"cheating\", is dishonest from\\nthe very commencement of the transaction. There is really no consent by the person,\\nwho is intentionally induced by deception to deliver the property or allow any person to\\nretain the property or is intentionally induced, as a result of deception, to do or omit to\\ndo anything, which he would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived, and which\\nact or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body,\\nmind, reputation or property. In short, thus, while in \"criminal breach of trust\", the\\naccused comes into possession of the property without dishonest intention and\\ndevelops dishonest intention subsequent to his coming into possession of the\\nproperty, the offence of \\'cheating\\' is one, wherein the accused has dishonest intention\\nfrom the very commencement of the transaction.426.'), ('409.18', 'Section 409 and section 477A IPC, 1860.—\\nContention of the accused is that scheme of sections 408 and 409 IPC, 1860 goes to\\nshow that distinct offences have been provided respectively for the clerks or servants\\nand for the bankers and the present petitioner has been charged for the offence under\\nsection 409 IPC, 1860 as he is a banker, but at the same time, he has been convicted\\nfor the offence under section 477A IPC, 1860, where bankers have not been included in\\nthe description of offence under section 477A IPC, 1860 and conviction under sections\\n477A and 409 IPC, 1860 cannot go hand to hand. The accused has been charged for\\nthe offence under section 409 IPC, 1860 as he was public servant at the relevant time\\nbeing a Postal Assistant and his contention that he was a banker is misplaced. The\\naccused has not been charged as a banker.427.'), ('409.19', 'Director.—\\nA director of a company is not only an agent but also a trustee of the assets of the\\ncompany which come to his hand. Thus having dominion and control over property he\\ncan come within the mischief of this section if he dishonestly misappropriates that\\nproperty to his own use.428. The manager of a rice mill was held liable under the\\nsection for causing disappearance of a quantity of paddy from a huge stock of the\\nmaterial entrusted to him.429.'), ('409.20', \"Directors of Company.—Vicarious liability.—\\nIt is to be noted that the concept of 'vicarious liability' is unknown to criminal law. As\\nobserved earlier, there is no speciﬁc allegation made against any person but the\\nmembers of the board and senior executives are joined as the persons looking after the\\nmanagement and business of the appellant Company.430. The Penal Code does not\\ncontain any provision for attaching vicarious liability on the part of the Managing\\nDirector or the Directors of the Company when the accused is the Company. The\\nlearned Magistrate failed to pose unto himself the correct question, viz., as to whether\\nthe complaint petition, even if given face value and taken to be correct in its entirety,\\nwould lead to the conclusion that the respondents herein were personally liable for any\\noffence. The Bank is a body corporate. Vicarious liability of the Managing Director and\\nDirector would arise provided any provision exists in that behalf in the Statute. Statutes\\nindisputably must contain provision ﬁxing such vicarious liabilities. Even for the said\\npurpose, it is obligatory on the part of the complainant to make requisite allegations\\nwhich would attract the provisions constituting vicarious liability.431. In the case of\\nPunjab National Bank v Surendra Prasad Sinha,432. a complaint was lodged by the\\ncomplainant for prosecution under sections 409, 109 and 114, IPC, 1860 against the\\nChairman, the Managing Director of the Bank and a host of oﬃcers Since the principal\\ndebtor defaulted in payment of debt, the Branch Manager of the bank on maturity of the\\nsaid ﬁxed deposit adjusted a part of the amount against the said loan. The complainant\\nalleged that the debt became barred by limitation and, therefore, the liability of the\\nguarantors also stood extinguished. It was, therefore, alleged that the oﬃcers of the\\nbank criminally embezzled the said amount with dishonest intention to save\\nthemselves from ﬁnancial obligation. The Magistrate without adverting whether the\\nallegations in the complaint prima facie make out an offence charged for, in a\\nmechanical manner, issued the process against all the accused persons. The High\\nCourt refused to quash the complaint and the matter ﬁnally came to Supreme Court.\\nThe Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed the proceedings and held that the\\ncomplaint was laid impleading the Chairman, the Managing Director of the Bank by\\nname and a host of oﬃcers. There lies responsibility and duty on the Magistracy to ﬁnd\\nwhether the concerned accused should be legally responsible for the offence charged\\nfor. Only on satisfying that the law casts liability or creates offence against the juristic\\nperson or the persons impleaded then only process would be issued.\"), ('409.21', \"Society.—\\nThe accused was in charge of a society's affairs. Shortage of funds was detected. It\\nwas held that the fact that the accused agreed to make good the shortage at a later\\npoint of time could not be treated as an admission of guilt on his part. Ingredients of\\nmisappropriation were not made out. The mere discrepancy in amount was not\\nsuﬃcient to sustain the conviction.433.\\nProsecution has to prove entrustment and not how property was dealt with.—The\\nprosecution has to show that the property in question was entrusted to the accused.

A property is stolen for the purpose of this section\\nwhen its possession is transferred by theft, extortion, robbery, dacoity or criminal\\nbreach of trust or which was obtained under misappropriation committed whether in\\nIndia or outside. An extended meaning is given to the words \\'stolen property\\' which are\\nused in the four subsequent sections. Not only things which have been stolen, extorted\\nor robbed but also things which have been obtained by criminal misappropriation or\\ncriminal breach of trust are within the meaning assigned to these words. Section 411\\nprovides punishment to the person who dishonestly receives stolen property. The\\nperson must have the knowledge that it is a stolen property. This section as also the\\nsucceeding sections are directed not against the principal offender, e.g., a thief, robber\\nor misappropriator but against the class of persons who trade in stolen articles and are\\nreceivers of stolen property. Principal offenders are therefore, outside the scope of this\\nsection. Accordingly the conviction of the principal offender is also not a prerequisite to\\nthe conviction of the receiver of stolen property under this section.444.'), ('411.1', 'Essential ingredients.—\\n(a) Dishonest receipt or retention of stolen property. (b) Knowledge or reason to believe\\nat the time of receipt that the property was obtained in the ways speciﬁed in the\\nsection. The offence of dishonest retention of property is almost contemporaneous\\nwith the offence of dishonestly receiving stolen property. A person who dishonestly\\nreceives property and retains it, must obviously continue to retain it. It is the duty of the\\nprosecution in order to bring home the guilt of a person under section 411 to prove:\\n(1) That the stolen property was in the possession of the accused.\\n(2) That some person other than the accused had possession of the property\\nbefore the accused got possession of it and\\n(3) That the accused had knowledge that the property was stolen.445. When the ﬁeld\\nfrom which the ornaments were recovered was an open one, and accessible to all and\\nsundry, it is diﬃcult to hold positively that the accused was is possession of these\\narticles. The fact of recovery by the accused is compatible with the circumstance of\\nsomebody else having placed the articles there and of the accused somehow acquiring\\nknowledge about their whereabouts and that being so, the fact of discovery cannot be\\nregarded as conclusive proof that the accused was in possession of these articles.446.\\nAs observed by the Apex Court in the case of N Madhavan v State of Kerala,447. as a\\nnormal rule after an inquiry or trial when the accused is discharged or acquitted the\\nCourt ought to restore the property from the person from whose custody it was taken\\nand in a case of conviction, it is the person from whose possession it was stolen, who\\nwould be entitled to its possession when the property seized is referable to such stolen\\nproperty.\\nhave been a change in the mental element of possession,—possession always\\nsubsisting animo et facto—from an honest to a dishonest condition of the mind in\\nrelation to the thing possessed. Where pursuant to a hire purchase agreement, on the\\ndefault of the purchaser to pay the instalment amount, the seller of a vehicle\\nrepossessed it, it was held that as there was no dishonest intention to retain on his\\npart, the provisions of this section were not attracted.448.'), ('411.2', \"Identity of stolen property.—\\nBefore a conviction can be recorded under this section it must be shown that the\\nproperty recovered and seized was stolen property. Where, therefore, the identity of the\\nproperty is not established, there cannot be any conviction under section 411, IPC,\\nmade punishable is not the receiving of stolen property from any particular person, but\\nreceiving such property knowing it to be stolen. The word 'believe' is a much stronger\\nword than suspect, and it involves the necessity of showing that the circumstances\\nwere such that a reasonable man must have felt convinced in his mind that the\\nproperty with which he was dealing must be stolen property.450.\"), ('411.3', 'Stolen property of the deceased.—\\nWhere stolen ornaments of the deceased which she had been wearing when she was\\nlast seen alive are discovered within three days of the murder in pursuance of an\\ninformation given by the accused and there is no other evidence, the accused can be\\nconvicted only under section 411 and not under section 302, IPC, 1860, or section 394,\\nIPC, 1860, as there is nothing to connect him with the murder or the robbery.451.'), ('411.4', 'Recent Possession.—\\nThere is a presumption under the law that where a person is found to be in a recent\\npossession of stolen or robbed articles, he must be the offender himself or must have\\nreceived them with knowledge. In reference to the meaning of the expression \"recent\\npossession\", the Supreme Court has suggested that no ﬁxed time limit can be laid\\ndown and each matter must go by its own facts. It varies according to whether the\\nproperty in question in its nature is capable of passing readily from hand to hand. If the\\ngoods are not of that kind, even one year may not be too long. In the present case,\\nhowever, there was no gap of time between the arrest of the accused and the recovery\\nand, hence, the presumption of his guilt.452.'), ('411.5', 'Sentencing.—\\nWhere the period of 12 years had elapsed since the institution of the case and the\\naccused (revision petitioner) remained in jail for ten months, his sentence was reduced\\nto the period already undergone.

While the charge of robbery under section 392\\nfailed, that of receiving stolen property became established by reason of the\\npresumption created by section 114 of the Evidence Act, 1872.454. When the\\nprosecution established beyond all reasonable doubt that M.O s. 25–27 belonged to\\nthe deceased No. 1, were found in the possession of A2, the burden shifts to the\\naccused to explain the same under section 114-A of the Evidence Act.

It depends upon the intention of the accused at the time of inducement which may\\nbe judged by his subsequent conduct, but for which the subsequent conduct is not the\\nsole test. Mere breach of contract cannot give rise to criminal prosecution under\\nsection 420, IPC, 1860, unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right at the\\nbeginning of the transaction, which is the time when the offence is said to have been\\ncommitted.477. There was allegation from one side that no payment was being made\\nunder the contract. The other side pleaded that part payments were made from time to\\ntime and the balance was withheld due to non-standard nature of the work and a letter\\nto that effect was issued. The Court said that the controversy was wholly of civil\\nnature. There was total absence of dishonest criminal intention to dupe contractions'\\nright from the inception of the relationship.478.

The allegation in the complaint was that the seller had not\\ndisclosed that one of his brothers had ﬁled a partition suit which was pending. There\\nwas no allegation that non-disclosure of the suit was intentional.

But in the case of criminal\\nbreach of trust, the person who comes into possession of but retains it or converts it to\\nhis own use against the terms of the contract.483.\\nCriminal breach of trust and cheating are two distinct offences generally involving\\ndishonest intention but mutually exclusive and different in basic concept.

Whenever a person fraudulently\\nrepresents as an existing fact that which is not an existing fact, he commits this\\noffence. A wilful misrepresentation of a deﬁnite fact with intent to defraud, cognizable\\nby the senses—as where a seller represents the quantity of coal to be 14 cwt. whereas\\nit is in fact only eight cwt. but so packed as to look more; or where the seller, by\\nmanoeuvring, contrives to pass off tasters of cheese as if extracted from the cheese\\noffered for sale, whereas it is not—is a cheating.485. Deception is a necessary\\ningredient for the offences of cheating under both parts of this section. The\\ncomplainant, therefore, necessarily needs to prove that the inducement had been\\ncaused by the deception exercised by the accused. Such deception must necessarily\\nproduce the inducement to part with or deliver property, which the complainant would\\nnot have parted with or delivered, but for the inducement resulting from deception. The\\nexplanation to the section would clearly indicate that there must be no dishonest\\nconcealment of facts. In other words, non-disclosure of relevant information would\\nalso be treated as a misrepresentation of facts leading to deception.486.\\nIt is not suﬃcient to prove that a false representation had been made but it is further\\nnecessary to prove that the representation was false to the knowledge of the accused\\nand was made in order to deceive the complainant.487. Where a party was persuaded\\nto take out a policy of insurance and the insurer subsequently failed to pay on the\\nhappening of the event insured against, it was held that a dishonest intention cannot be\\ninferred from a subsequent failure to fulﬁl a promise.488.\\nIt is not necessary that the false pretence should be made in express words; it can be\\ninferred from all the circumstances attending the obtaining of the property,489. or from\\nconduct.490. If a person orders out goods on credit promising to pay for them on a\\nparticular day knowing that it was impossible for him to pay, this would amount to\\ncheating. But the mere fact that he is in embarrassed circumstances does not lead to\\nsuch inference.491.'), ('415.6', \"Cheque discounting facility.—\\nThe complainant is required to show that accused had fraudulent or dishonest\\nintention at the time of making promise or representation.

The section is divided into two parts, the second of which\\nprovides for the case of a person who, by deceiving another intentionally, induces the\\nperson so deceived to do an act which causes or is likely to cause damage or harm\\nalthough the deceiver has not acted fraudulently or dishonestly.493.\\ndeception causes a person fraudulently or dishonestly to acquire property by delivery,\\nor to retain property already in his possession.\\nProperty does not have to be a thing which has money or market value. Since a\\npassport is a tangible thing and a document of great importance for travel abroad there\\ncan be no doubt that it is property within the meaning of this section. Thus where the\\naccused obtained several passports by making false representation to the passport\\nissuing authority they were rightly convicted under sections 420 and 420/120B, IPC,\\ndo or omit, etc.'.—Intention is the gist of the offence. The person cheated must have\\nbeen intentionally induced to do an act which he would not have done or to omit to do\\nan act which he would have done, owing to the deception practised on him. The\\nintention at the time of the offence and the consequence of the act or omission itself\\nhas to be considered.495. Intent refers to the dominant motive of action, and not to a\\ncasual or merely possible result.496. Where the facts narrated in the complaint revealed\\na commercial transaction, it was held that such a transaction could not lead to the\\nconclusion of a criminal intention to cheat. The Court said that the crux of this offence\\nis the intention of the accused person.497.\\nSections 415 read with section 420 indicates that fraudulent or dishonest inducement\\non the part of the accused must be at the inception and not at a subsequent stage. In\\nthis case, blank cheques were handed over to the accused during the period 2000–\\n2004 for use of business purposes but the dispute between the parties admittedly\\narose much after that, i.e., in 2005. Thus, no case for proceeding against the\\nrespondent under section 420 is made out. Filling up of the blanks in a cheque by itself\\nwould not amount to forgery. A case for proceeding against the respondents under\\nsection 406 IPC, 1860 has been made out. A cheque being a property, the same was\\nentrusted to the respondents. If the property has been misappropriated has been used\\nfor a purpose for which the same had been handed over, a case under section 406 IPC,\\n1860 may be found to have been made out. It may be true that even in a proceeding\\nunder section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, the appellant could raise a defence\\nthat the cheques were not meant to be used towards discharge of a lawful liability or a\\ndebt, but the same by itself would not mean that in an appropriate case, a complaint\\npetition cannot be allowed to be ﬁled.498.\\nThe existence of fraudulent intention at the time of making promise or\\nmisrepresentation is a necessary ingredient. The mere failure on the part of the\\naccused to keep up the promise is not suﬃcient to prove the existence of such\\nintention from the beginning.499.\"), ('415.7', 'Fraudulent or dishonest intention to be at the outset.—\\nTo hold a person guilty of cheating it is necessary to show that he had fraudulent or\\ndishonest intention at the time of making the promise. From his mere failure to keep up\\nthe promise subsequently such a culpable intention right at the beginning, that is, when\\nhe made the promise cannot be presumed.500.\\nA beverages company entered into a bottling agreement with a bottling company for\\nbottling services for a period of ﬁve years, subsequently, however, the beverage\\ncompany transferred its trade mark to another company to which the bottling\\nagreement was also assigned. But the latter company terminated the agreement. The\\nbottling company ﬁled a complaint for cheating saying that they had spent a huge\\namount in setting up their bottling unit. The complaint was quashed. There was no\\narrangement with the beverages company at the time when the complainant was\\nbringing up his unit, nor did the beverages company have any intention of cheating\\nfrom the start or at any subsequent stage.501.\\nAlthough it is necessary that there should be misrepresentation from the very\\nbeginning, the intention to cheat may in some cases develop at a later stage in the\\nprocess of formation of the contract. The respondent in this case was a co-sharer in\\nthe joint property. The other co-sharers sold it to others representing that they had one-\\nthird share in the property when in fact it was not so. It was held that no cheating was\\npracticed in the transaction upon the complaining co-sharer. It was a fraud on others.\\nThe complainant could not launch a criminal prosecution against them.502.\\nThe illustration (b) provided in section 415, IPC, 1860, very well covers the facts of this\\ncase for cheating by the accused. The illustration provides that \"(b) A, by putting a\\ncounterfoil mark on an article, intentionally deceives Z into a belief that this article was\\nmade in a certain celebrated manufacturer, and thus dishonestly induces Z to buy and pay\\nfor the article, A cheats.\"503.'), ('415.8', 'Civil and Criminal liability.—\\nA distinction must be made between a civil wrong and a criminal wrong.

The case of breach of trust or cheating is both a\\ncivil wrong and a criminal offence, but under certain situations where the act alleged\\nwould predominantly be a civil wrong, such an act does not constitute a criminal\\noffence.505. Sometimes case may apparently look to be of civil nature or may involve a\\ncommercial transaction but civil disputes or commercial disputes in certain\\ncircumstances may also contain ingredients of criminal offences and such disputes\\nhave to be entertained notwithstanding they are also civil disputes.506.'), ('415.9', 'Cheating by Misrepresentation as to Encumbrance to Property.—\\nIt is the intention which is important and not whether a man is under a legal duty to\\ndisclose or suppress facts within his knowledge.

It enacts a rule which, while preserving to the owner the\\nmaximum rights of property, prevents his using it to the injury or damage of another\\nand all fortiori it punishes all who wantonly cause such injury or damage to another\\'s\\nproperty. Neither malice nor an intention to cause injury is essential for the constitution\\nof the offence which may be committed by injury caused with only the knowledge of\\nlikelihood, which must, however, he strictly proved. The ﬁrst part of the section sets out\\nthe mens rea on the guilty mind, which is the intention or the knowledge of likelihood of\\ncausing wrongful loss or damage to the public or to any person. The second part of the\\nsection pertains to the actus res, that is to say, the criminal act, which consists in\\ncausing destruction to any property or any such change in any property or in the\\nsituation thereof as destroys or diminishes its value or utility or affects it injuriously.\\nThe express mention of \"damage\" in the section is indicative of the fact that the\\npurview of the offence of \"mischief\" is not intended to be conﬁned only to cases of\\n\"wrongful loss\", but also to engulf within it all such cases of damages by unlawful\\nmeans. Destruction of any property within the meaning of the section carries with it the\\nimplication that something should be done to the property contrary to its natural use\\nand serviceableness. Mischief implies the causing of wrongful loss or damage and no\\nloss or damage is wrongful unless it involves invasion of a legal right. In any other case\\nit is damnum sine injuria.608.\\nActs done or attempted to be done in bona ﬁde assertion of a right, however ill-founded\\nin law that right may be, cannot amount to the offence of mischief within section\\nhis kotha and which pathway he had been using for the last 22 years, it was held no\\noffence under section 425, IPC, 1860, was committed.610.\\nthe public or to any person\\'.—This section does not necessarily contemplate damage\\nof a destructive character. It requires merely that there should be an invasion of right\\nand diminution of the value of one\\'s property, caused by that invasion of right, which\\nmust have been contemplated by the doer of it when he did it.611. A dominant owner,\\nhaving a right of way over land belonging to another, has no right himself to remove an\\nobstruction unless his right of way is impaired by it. If he does so, he has employed\\nunlawful means and if loss of property is caused thereby to another, he is guilty under\\nthis section.612. It is no answer to a charge of mischief to plead that the motive of the\\naccused was to beneﬁt himself, and not to injure another, if he knew that he could only\\nsecure that beneﬁt by causing wrongful loss to another.613. Where while taking\\npossession of the allotted portion of a house on the basis of a valid allotment order, the\\ngoods were simply put outside the premises and no obstruction was caused to the\\ncomplainant landlord to collect his goods, offences under sections 425 and 427 were\\nnot made out.614.\\nis the essence of this offence that the perpetrator must cause the destruction of\\nproperty or such change in it as destroys or diminishes its value or utility. The\\ndestruction of a document evidencing an agreement void for immorality constitutes\\nthis offence as it can be used as evidence for other collateral purposes.615. The\\naccused on receiving delivery of a registered article from a Postmaster was requested\\nto sign an acknowledgement for the article received by him, but instead of returning the\\nsame duly signed he tore it up and threw it on the ground. It was held that he was guilty\\nof mischief.616.\\nThe \\'destruction\\' or \\'change\\' should be contrary to the natural use and serviceableness\\nof the property in question. If a person unauthorisedly allows goats to graze in a forest,\\nthe grazing rights in which are restricted to holders of permits, the offence of mischief\\nis not committed as by such an act the grass is only put to its normal use.617. The\\naccused had a dispute about the possession of a certain land with the complainant.\\nThe complainant dug a well with a view to cultivate the said land, but the accused\\nforcibly entered on the land and damaged the well. It was held that accused were guilty\\nof mischief even though the complainant was a trespasser.618. Merely disconnecting\\nelectric supply does not amount to destruction of property or to such a change in\\nproperty as destroys or diminishes its utility or value, and does not constitute an\\noffence of mischief.619. A contrary view to this view of the Calcutta High Court has\\nbeen taken by the Delhi High Court to say that switching off the electric supply by the\\nlandlord to the tenanted premises, even without causing damage to the distribution\\nboard or wires supplying electric current diminishes the value and utility of the tenanted\\npremises within the meaning of section 425, IPC, 1860.620. In order to make out an\\noffence of mischief it is necessary to show that there was wrongful loss or damage to\\nthe property. So unless the property was destroyed or underwent such a change due to\\nthe action of the accused that its utility or value was diminished, no offence under\\nsection 425, IPC, 1860, could be said to have been committed. Thus where a family\\ntook shelter in the door-way of an uninhabitable and dilapidated house by throwing\\naway a few articles, the offence of mischief was not committed.621.

Where a person owns land on which there is a drain, the water running\\nthrough which is used as of right by way of easement by another person, the former is\\nnot guilty of mischief, if the drain is destroyed by him because an easement does not\\ncome within the purview of 'property' within the meaning of section 425.624.

The offence\\nintended to be committed so as to constitute \\'criminal trespass\\' is any offence. But if\\nsuch offence intended to be committed is one punishable with imprisonment and the\\ncriminal trespass is committed in a dwelling house, then the offence which is made out\\nis not one punishable under section 448 IPC, 1860 but one punishable under section\\n451 IPC, 1860 which is an aggravated form of house trespass.673.\\nsuﬃcient to constitute house-trespass.674.

The second is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or\\notherwise, alters a document in any material part, without lawful authority, after it has\\nbeen made or executed by either himself or any other person.\\nC. The third is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign,\\nexecute or alter a document knowing that such person could not by reason of (a)\\nunsoundness of mind, or (b) intoxication, or (c) deception practised upon him, know the\\ncontents of the document or the nature of the alteration. In short, a person is said to\\nhave made a \\'false document\\', if (i) he made or executed a document claiming to be\\nsomeone else or authorised by someone else, or (ii) he altered or tampered a\\ndocument, or (iii) he obtained a document by practicing deception, or from a person not\\nin control of his senses.12. Making of any false document, in view of the deﬁnition of\\n\\'forgery\\' is the sine qua non therefor. What would amount to making of a false\\ndocument is speciﬁed in section 464 thereof. What is, therefore, necessary is to\\nexecute a document with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document\\ninter alia was made by the authority of a person by whom or by whose authority he\\nknows that it was not made.13. In the case of Mir Nagvi Askari v CBI, the Court held that:\\nA person is said to make a false document or record if he satisﬁes one of the three\\nconditions as noticed hereinbefore and provided for under the said section. The ﬁrst\\ncondition being that the document has been falsiﬁed with the intention of causing it to be\\nbelieved that such document has been made by a person, by whom the person falsifying the\\ndocument knows that it was not made. Clearly the documents in question in the present\\ncase, even if it be assumed to have been made dishonestly or fraudulently, had not been\\nmade with the intention of causing it to be believed that they were made by or under the\\nauthority of some one else. The second criteria of the section deals with a case where a\\nperson without lawful authority alters a document after it has been made. There has been\\nno allegation of alteration of the voucher in question after they have been made. Therefore\\nin our opinion the second criteria of the said section is also not applicable to the present\\ncase. The third and ﬁnal condition of Section 464 deals with a document, signed by a\\nperson who due to his mental capacity does not know the contents of the documents which\\nwere made i.e because of intoxication or unsoundness of mind etc. Such is also not the\\ncase before us. Indisputably therefore the accused before us could not have been convicted\\nwith the making of a false document.14.\\nTo attract the second clause of section 464 there has to be alteration of document\\ndishonestly and fraudulently. So in order to attract the clause \\'secondly\\' if the document\\nis to be altered it has to be for some gain or with such objective on the part of the\\naccused. Merely changing a document does not make it a false document.15.'), ('464.1', 'Making of false document.—\\nFalse document is said to have been made when a person dishonestly or fraudulently\\nmakes a document with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document\\nwas made by some other person.16.'), ('464.2', 'Issuance of a caste certiﬁcate.—\\nThe Sub-Divisional Oﬃcer (SDO) issued a caste certiﬁcate.

Under section\\n463 the making of a false document with any of the intents therein mentioned is\\nforgery, and section 464 sets forth when a person is said to make a 'false document'\\nwithin the meaning of the Code.\\nThe deﬁnition of forgery in the Code is not as simple and clear as the deﬁnition of\\nforgery in common law.

Incorporation or inclusion of a false statement in a document\\nwould not ipso facto make the document false. For a document to be false, it has to tell\\na lie about itself.20.'), ('465.2', 'Publication of book.—\\nThere was allegation that the accused person, in order to induce the public to purchase\\nthe book, falsely represented that the book was by a certain person. There was no\\nallegation that the accused himself had written the book and represented it to be that\\nof some other person. The Court said such allegations, even if true, do not make out a\\ncase of forgery. The offence of cheating could not also be said to have been made out\\nbecause it was a consequential offence.21.\\nWhere the allegation was that the accused, who was working as a stenographer in the\\nHigh Court, had fabricated a forged bail order and the evidence showed that the bail\\norder in question was in fact written by the accused, the ﬁnding of the High Court that\\nthe paper could not be said to be a document in the absence of signature of the\\naccused was held to be not tenable. The document could have been used for causing\\nwrongful loss or obtaining wrongful gain. Hence, the offence under sections 466 and\\n468 was made out.22.\\nmust be intended to be caused by the false document to the public or any individual.23.\\nThus, a police-oﬃcer who alters his diary so as to show that he had not kept certain\\npersons under surveillance does not commit forgery, inasmuch as there is no risk of\\nloss or injury to any individual and the element of fraud as deﬁned in section 25 is\\nabsent.24. It is the intent to cause damage or injury which constitutes the gist of this\\noffence. It is immaterial whether damage, injury or fraud is actually caused or not.25.\\nMere making of a false document would not constitute defrauding unless injury or\\nintent to cause injury to the person deceived was also proved.26.\\nTo tamper with a proceeding in a Court of Justice in order to obtain from the Court a\\ndecision or order, which it otherwise would not make, is as much a public mischief as\\nto attempt to secure the unauthorised release of a prisoner from jail or to obtain for an\\nunqualiﬁed person credentials entitling him to practise as a surgeon or to navigate a\\nship.27.\\nwill be guilty of forgery if he counterfeits documents in order to support it. See\\nillustrations (f), (g), (h) and (i). An actual intention to convert an illegal or doubtful claim\\ninto an apparently legal one is dishonesty and will amount to forgery.28.\\nThe term \\'claim\\' is not limited in its application to a claim to property. It may be a claim\\nto anything, as for instance, a claim to a woman as the claimant\\'s wife, a claim to the\\ncustody of a child as being the claimant\\'s child, or a claim to be admitted to attendance\\nat a law class in a college, or to be admitted to a university or other examination, or a\\nclaim to the possession of immovable or any other kind of property.29.\\nwith which it is intended that false document shall cause a person to part should be in\\nexistence at the time when the false document was made. For example, if A gave an\\norder to B to buy the material for making and to make a silver tea service for him, and\\nC, before the tea service was made or the materials for making it had been bought\\nwere to make a false letter purporting, but falsely, to be signed by A, authorizing B to\\ndeliver to D the tea service when made, C would have committed forgery within the\\nmeaning of section 463 by making that false document with intent to cause B to part\\nwith property, namely, the tea service, when made.30. A written certiﬁcate has been\\nheld to be \\'property\\' within the meaning of this section.31.\\ninvolves two elements, namely, deceit and injury to the person deceived. Injury is\\nsomething other than economic loss that is deprivation of property, whether movable\\nor immovable, or of money, and it will include any harm whatever caused to any person\\nin body, mind, reputation or such others. In short, it is a non-economic or non-pecuniary\\nloss. A beneﬁt or advantage to the deceiver will almost always cause loss or detriment\\nto the deceived. Even in those rare cases where there is a beneﬁt or advantage to the\\ndeceiver, but no corresponding loss to the deceived the second condition is\\nsatisﬁed.32.\\n\\'dishonestly\\' and presumably in a sense not covered by the latter word. If, however, it be\\nheld that \\'fraudulently\\' implies deprivation, either actual or intended, then apparently\\nthat word would perform no function which would not have been fully discharged by\\nthe word \\'dishonestly\\' and its use would be mere surplusage. So far as such a\\nconsideration carries any weight, it obviously inclines in favour of the view that the\\nword \\'fraudulently\\' should not be conﬁned to transactions of which deprivation of\\nproperty forms a part.33.\\n\\'writing\\' or \\'printing\\' it, but signing or otherwise executing it; as in legal phrase we speak\\nof \\'making an indenture\\' or \\'making a promissory note\\', by which is not meant the\\nwriting out of the form of the instrument, but the sealing or signing it as a deed or note.\\nThe fact that the word \\'makes\\' is used in the section in conjunction with the words\\n\\'signs\\', \\'seals\\' or \\'executes\\', or \\'makes any mark denoting the execution\\', etc., seems to\\nvery clearly to denote that this is its true meaning. What constitutes a false document\\nor part of a document is not the writing of any number of words which in themselves\\nare innocent, but aﬃxing the seal or signature of some person to the document, or part\\nof a document, knowing that the seal or signature is not his, and that he gave no\\nauthority to aﬃx it. In other words, the falsity consists in the document, or part of a\\ndocument, being signed or sealed with the name or seal of a person who did not in fact\\nsign or seal it\".34.'), ('465.3', 'Fabricating letter or certiﬁcate.—\\nIn a case, the allegation was that the accused made false document for getting sim\\ncards of mobile phones.

There is a fundamental difference between a person executing a sale deed\\nclaiming that the property conveyed is his property, and a person executing a sale deed\\nby impersonating the owner or falsely claiming to be authorised or empowered by the\\nowner, to execute the deed on owner\\'s behalf. When a person executes a document\\nconveying a property describing it as his, there are two possibilities. The ﬁrst is that he\\nhas a bona ﬁde belief that the property actually belongs to him. The second is that he\\nmay be dishonestly or fraudulently claiming it to be his even though he knows that it is\\nnot his property. But to fall under ﬁrst category of \"false documents\", it is not suﬃcient\\nthat a document has been made or executed dishonestly or fraudulently. There is a\\nfurther requirement that it should have been made with the intention of causing it to be\\nbelieved that such document was made or executed by, or by the authority of a person,\\nby whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made or executed. When a\\ndocument is executed by a person claiming a property which is not his, he is not\\nclaiming that he is someone else nor is he claiming that he is authorised by someone\\nelse. Therefore, execution of such document (purporting to convey some property of\\nwhich he is not the owner) is not execution of a false document as deﬁned under\\nsection 464 of the Code.

If the marriage is not a valid\\none according to the law applicable to the parties no question of its being void by\\nreason of its taking place during the life of the wife or the husband of the person arises.\\nIf the marriage is not a valid marriage, it is no marriage in the eyes of the law.17. The\\nSupreme Court in another case had held that in a bigamy case, the second marriage as\\na fact, that is to say, the essential ceremonies constituting it, must be proved.18.\\nAdmission of marriage by the accused is not evidence of it for the purposes of proving\\nmarriage in an adultery or bigamy case.19. Thus, where the second Hindu marriage was\\nnot proved by showing saptapadi and homam, the mere production of a marriage\\ncertiﬁcate under section 16 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 would not be suﬃcient to\\nprove that the second marriage was performed validly by performing all the essential\\nceremonies of a valid marriage. The mere fact of subsequent registration of the second\\nmarriage does not prove the validity of second marriage.20. Merely because the second\\nmarriage even if performed by performing all the essential ceremonies turns out to be\\nvoid by virtue of section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, it cannot be said that\\nsection 494, IPC, 1860 will not be attracted.21. If the second marriage was not proved\\nto have been validly performed by observing essential ceremonies and customs in the\\ncommunity, the conviction under section 494, IPC, 1860 could not be maintained.22.\\nPerhaps the Courts in India were obliged to take the view they have taken because of\\nthe word \"solemnised\" occurring in section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and the\\ninhibition contained in the proviso to section 50 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1972 which\\nforbids taking into consideration even the opinion of a person with special means of\\nknowledge to show that the two persons were always received and treated as husband\\nand wife by their friends and relatives so far offences under sections 494, 495, etc., IPC,\\n1860 are concerned.23.\\nThus, if one deliberately keeps a small lacuna, e.g., instead of taking the seven steps\\n(saptapadi), takes only six steps while celebrating the second marriage, one can easily avoid\\nthe penalty prescribed by these sections even though one virtually ruins the lives of two\\ngirls. If we are to effectively root out polygamy from this country, we must amend s. 494,\\nIPC, and s. 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, in such a way that anyone who goes through a\\nform of marriage during the lifetime of his or her spouse will come within the mischief of\\nthe offence of bigamy. At the same time we should also delete from the proviso to s. 50 of\\nthe Indian Evidence Act, the last portion which says \\'or in prosecutions u/s. 494, 495, 497 or\\n498 of the Indian Penal Code\\'. The National Committee on the Status of Women too made,\\nmore or less, similar recommendations in its report. It is also felt that ss. 493, 494, 495 and\\n496, IPC, which have an element of cheating in them and affect unsophisticated rural\\nwomen more than women in urban areas should be made cognizable so that these poor\\nwomen could get justice without being required to engage lawyers at their own cost.24.\\nThe Courts are also changing their viewpoint. In Indu Bhagya Natekar v Bhagya\\nPandurang Natekar,25. it was held that it is not correct to say that in every case of\\nbigamy, unless the second marriage can be proved by bringing in the evidence of the\\nperformance of ceremonies itself, a conviction under section 494 is virtually\\nimpossible. The accused can be convicted even if there is other reliable evidence to\\nestablish the charge.\\nWhere in a particular community \\'saptapadi\\' was not an essential ceremony, the\\nprovisions of section 7-A of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 applied and, therefore, the\\nperformance of other ceremonies prevalent in the community constituted a valid\\nmarriage.26.\\nUnder the provisions of the Indian Christian Marriage Act (XV of 1872), the ﬁrst\\naccused, who was a Roman Catholic Indian Christian, married the complainant, who\\nwas a Protestant, in a Protestant Church, the ceremony being performed by a\\nProtestant Pastor, and subsequently, after obtaining a release deed from her, he\\nmarried the second accused in a Roman Catholic Church, the ceremony being\\nperformed by a Roman Catholic priest. It was held that the ﬁrst accused had\\ncommitted the offence of bigamy punishable under this section. The release deed\\nexecuted by the complainant did not operate as a dissolution of the marriage between\\nthe ﬁrst accused and herself. The marriage between the ﬁrst accused and the\\ncomplainant was a legal and valid marriage and, as it was subsisting when the ﬁrst\\naccused married the second accused, the marriage of the ﬁrst accused with the\\nsecond accused was void by reason of its taking place during the life of the\\ncomplainant.27.\\nGood faith and mistake of law are no defences to a charge of bigamy.28.'), ('494.4', 'Conversion from Hinduism.—\\nA married Hindu person contracted second marriage after embracing Islam.

Before, it was struck down, the cognizance of the offence was limited to\\nadultery committed with a married woman, and the male offender alone was made\\nliable to punishment. Thus, under the Code, adultery was an offence committed by a\\nthird person against a husband in respect of his wife. A married man was not liable if\\nhad sexual intercourse with an unmarried woman, or with a widow, or even with a\\nmarried woman whose husband consented to it.\\nPrior to the judgment in Joseph Shine case, the Supreme Court in Sowmithri Vishnu's case46.\\nhad upheld the constitutional validity of section 497, IPC, 1860. In Joseph Shine v UOI, AIR\\n2018 SC 4898 , the Supreme Court observed that: Adultery is different from an offence\\ncommitted under Section 498-A or any violation of the Protection of Women from Domestic\\nViolence Act, 2005 or, for that matter, the protection conceived of under Section 125 of the\\nCode of Criminal Procedure or Sections 306 or 304B or 494 IPC.

It is for him to establish that the source on\\nwhich he acted is a proper source on which he is entitled and he did with care and\\ncircumspection.

The\\npublisher of a newspaper is responsible for defamatory matter published in such paper\\nwhether he knows the contents of such paper or not.34.

The owner of a journal in order to be liable under section 499 has\\nto have direct responsibility for the publication of the defamatory statement and he\\nmust also have the intention to harm, or knowledge or reason to believe that the\\nimputation will harm the reputation of person concerned. The owner of a journal qua\\nhas no responsibility under the section.36.

It was alleged that there was a criminal\\nconspiracy in the matter between the managing editor, resident editor and executing\\neditor. All of them were liable to be prosecuted.38. A chief editor of a newspaper cannot\\nsay that he is not responsible for selection and publication of matters in the\\nnewspaper.

At this stage, in our opinion, it would have been premature for the High Court to\\nconsider the materials placed by the, appellant before it so as to arrive at a deﬁnite\\nconclusion that there was no element of bad faith on the part of the appellant in making the\\nsaid complaint before the police authorities.116.'), ('500.33', \"Exception 9.—Good faith, individual interest or public good.—\\nThis Exception posits that the person to whom the communication is made has an\\ninterest in protecting the person making the accusation. Besides the bona ﬁdes of the\\nperson making the imputation, the person to whom the imputation is conveyed must\\nhave a common interest with the person making it which is served by the\\ncommunication.117. The interest of the person referred to in this Exception has to be\\nreal and legitimate when communication is made in protection of the interest of the\\nperson making it. The privilege extends only to a communication upon the subject with\\nrespect to which the privilege extends and the privilege can be claimed in exercise of\\nthe right or safeguarding of the interest which creates the privilege.118. The regional\\nmanager of a bank issued conﬁdential circular to branch managers of his region\\nadvising them to be vigilant while dealing with persons included in the list including the\\ncomplainant. The circular was issued in his oﬃcial capacity in public interest and under\\ninstructions of the Central oﬃce. The Court said that the circular was covered by\\nException 9. Therefore, even if the allegations made in the complaint were true, no\\noffence would be made out under section 500.119.\\nThis exception relates to private communication which a person makes in good faith\\nfor the protection of his own interest. This exception covers not only such allegations\\nof facts as can be proved true but also expression of opinions and personal inferences.\\nIt has been incorporated to protect the interests of the parties in their business\\ntransaction which are generally done bona ﬁde and, therefore, the rule of public good on\\nwhich this principle is based is, that honest transaction of business and social\\nintercourse would otherwise be deprived of the protection which they should enjoy.\\nWhether any imputation made is with a motive or mala ﬁde intention to lower the\\nreputation or is made in good faith is to be determined from the facts and\\ncircumstances of the case. Undisputedly, the requirement of good faith and public\\ngood, both, are to be satisﬁed and the failure to prove good faith would exclude the\\napplication of Exception 9 in favour of the accused even if the requirement of public\\ngood is satisﬁed. The words 'good faith' as appearing in exception 9th not only require\\nlogical infallibility but also due care and attention.120.\\nThis Exception refers to any imputation made in good faith, whereas the ﬁrst Exception\\napplies only to true imputation made for the public good. That he acted in good faith\\nmust be proved by the accused.121. Question of good faith is a question of fact and\\nhas to be decided in course of the trial and at the initial stage. The journalists do not\\nenjoy any special privilege.122.\\nIn determining the question of good faith, regard should be to the intellectual capacity\\nof the accused, his predilections and the surrounding facts.123.\\nWhere a rustic villager objected to the appointment of the complainant as a village\\nmunsiff in the bona ﬁde belief that he was a rowdy and as such undesirable for a public\\npost like this, it was held that he acted in good faith and was protected by this\\nException.124.\\nIn order to establish good faith and bona ﬁdes it has to be seen ﬁrst the circumstances\\nunder which the defamatory matter was written or uttered; secondly, whether there was\\nany malice; thirdly, whether the accused made any inquiry before he made the\\nallegations; fourthly, whether there are reasons to accept the version that he acted with\\ncare and caution and ﬁnally whether there is preponderance of probability that the\\naccused acted in good faith.125.\\nThe burden lies on the person accused to prove the bona ﬁde aspect of his publication.\\nCross-examination of the complainant can be used as a device for establishing good-\\nfaith. An imputation was made in a newspaper item that the complainant lady doctor\\nhad duped the Government by presenting false transfer allowance bills. The lady\\ndoctor's sole testimony that the publication harmed her reputation was held to be not\\nsuﬃcient to sustain her complaint. The accused showed that the publication was in\\ngood faith and in public interest.126.\\nWhere the agreement for selling their properties for settling their dues was signed by\\nthe accused persons and registered before the Sub-Registrar in the presence of the\\naccused but subsequently a publication in the newspaper was made by the accused\\nafter about two and a half months that the agreement was executed under compulsion,\\nit was held that the publication was not made in 'good faith' and could not be brought\\nunder Exception 9 of section 499.127.\\nThe ninth Exception to section 499 provides that it is not defamation to make an\\nimputation on the character of another provided that the imputation be made in good\\nfaith for the protection of the interests of the person making it, or of any other person,\\nor for the public good. Even if it is assumed that the accused No. 1 and other accused\\nmade the imputation against the respondent No. 1 that he had written the letters and\\nthus, that imputation was made against his character, still that was made in good faith\\nbecause they wanted protection of the interest of the members of the family of\\naccused No. 1 and particularly his daughter. They did not approach any unconnected\\nperson, but police who could protect the interest of the accused No. 1 and his family\\nmembers. In view of the legal position and the facts, which are clear from the\\ncomplaint and the documents submitted with the complaint, it is clear that the case is\\nclearly covered by Exceptions 8 and 9 and no case under section 500 IPC, 1860 could\\nbe made out.128.\"), ('500.34', 'Club committee.—\\nThe committee members of a social club, even if wrong, are given protection under this\\nException, without which it would be impossible for such a body to function. Where the\\nrespondent, who was the wife of a member of a social club and was privileged to use\\nthe club, preferred a complaint against the members of the committee for defaming\\nher in a letter addressed by them to her husband, it was held that as the committee had\\nacted in good faith, even if they were mistaken they were protected by this\\nException.129.'), ('500.35', \"Communication by member of caste.—\\nThere is a dividing line between the passing of a resolution at a caste meeting and its\\ncommunication by the authorities of the caste to its members in the discharge of their\\nsocial duty.

There must\\nnot be excessive publication, e.g., publication in a newspaper.131. Where a libellous\\ncommunication is made regarding a member of a caste, the mere fact that the person\\nmaking such communication is a member of a caste will not of itself suﬃce to make\\nthe communication privileged.132.

The Bombay High Court has not followed the English\\nrule in cases of criminal prosecution on the ground that English law could not be\\nresorted to where it went beyond the terms of section 499: but in civil actions it has\\nfollowed the dictum of the Privy Council in Baboo Gunnesh Dutt Singh v Mugneeram\\nChowdhry.134. The Allahabad High Court has gone a step further and held that cases of\\ndefamation under the Code as well as civil suits for damages must be decided in\\naccordance with the provisions embodied in the IPC, 1860 and the Indian Evidence Act.\\nThe Calcutta High Court has held that the liability of a person prosecuted for\\ndefamation must be determined by the application of the provisions of the IPC, 1860\\nand not otherwise.135.

The\\nallegation was that the averments contained in the pleadings and oral evidence in a\\nsuit ﬁled by the accused constituted defamatory statements.

It\\nmakes punishable all attempts to commit offences punishable with imprisonment and\\nnot only those punishable for life or death.3.\\nA person commits the offence of 'attempt to commit a particular offence' when (i) he\\nintends to commit that particular offence; and (ii) he, having made preparations and\\nwith the intention to commit the offence, does an act towards its commission; such an\\nact need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of that offence, but must\\nbe an act during the course of committing that offence, section 511, IPC, 1860 is\\nattracted.4. An attempt to commit an offence is an act, or a series of acts, which leads\\ninevitably to the commission of the offence, unless something, which the doer of the\\nact neither foresaw nor intended, happens to prevent this. An attempt may be\\ndescribed to be an act done in part execution of a criminal design, amounting to more\\nthan mere preparation, but falling short of actual consummation, and, possessing,\\nexcept for failure to consummate, all the elements of the substantive crime. In other\\nwords, an attempt consists in it the intent to commit a crime, falling short of, its actual\\ncommission or consummation/completion. It may consequently be deﬁned as that\\nwhich if not prevented would have resulted in the full consummation of the act\\nattempted. The illustrations given in section 511 clearly show the legislative intention\\nto make a difference between the cases of a mere preparation and an attempt.5.\\nIn Om Prakash's case6. the Supreme Court has clearly held that like section 511, IPC,\\n1860 in section 307, IPC, 1860 to the act need not be the penultimate act.\"), ('511.1', \"Essentials.—\\nIn every crime, there is ﬁrst intention to commit it; second, preparation to commit it;\\nthird, attempt to commit it. If the third stage, that is attempt is successful, then the\\ncrime is complete. If the attempt fails, the crime is not complete but the law punishes\\nthe person attempting the act. An 'attempt' is made punishable, because every attempt,\\nalthough it fails of success, must create alarm, which, of itself, is an injury, and the\\nmoral guilt of the offender is the same as if he had succeeded.\\nA culprit ﬁrst intends to commit the offence, then makes preparation for committing it\\nand thereafter attempts to commit the offence. If the attempt succeeds, he has\\ncommitted the offence, if it fails due to reasons beyond his control, he is said to have\\nattempted to commit the offence. Attempt to commit an offence can be said to begin\\nwhen the preparations are complete and the culprit commences to do something with\\nthe intention of committing the offence and which is a step towards the commission of\\nthe offence. The moment he commences to do an act with the necessary intention, he\\ncommences his attempt to commit the offence—the act need not be the penultimate\\nact towards the commission of the offence but it must be an act during the course of\\ncommitting that offence.7.\\n(1) Intention.—Intention is the direction of conduct towards the object chosen upon\\nconsidering the motives which suggest the choice.8. The will is not to be taken for the\\ndeed, unless there be some external act which shows that progress has been made in\\nthe direction of it, or towards maturing and affecting it. In an attempt to commit an\\noffence, there must be intention to commit the crime combined with doing of some act\\nadopted to, but falling short of its actual commission.9.\\n(2) Preparation.—Preparation consists in devising or arranging the means or measures\\nnecessary for the commission of an offence.10.\"), ('511.2', 'Removal of rice bags from g o d o w n  in order to sell them.—\\nA Government stockist removed 80 bags of rice from a godown in his charge and\\nconcealed them in a room with a view to sell them and appropriate the sale proceeds. It\\nwas held that the act of the stockist amounted only to preparation and therefore, he\\nwas not guilty of any offence.11.'), ('511.3', 'Running towards well for committing suicide.—\\nA woman ran to a well stating she would jump into it, and she was caught before she\\ncould reach it. It was held that she could not be convicted of an attempt to commit\\nsuicide as she might have changed her mind before jumping into the well.12.\\n(3) Attempt.—Attempt is the direct movement towards the commission after the\\npreparations are made.13. In State of Maharashtra v Mohd. Yakub,14. reported in the\\nApex Court considered the deﬁnition of \\'attempt to commit crime\\' as the last proximate\\nact which a person does towards the commission of an offence, the consummation of\\nthe offence being hindered by circumstances beyond his control. It was observed by\\nthe Apex Court that what constitutes an \"attempt\" is a mixed question of law and fact,\\ndepending largely on the circumstances of the particular case. \"Attempt\" deﬁes a\\nprecise and exact deﬁnition. Broadly speaking, all crimes which consist of the\\ncommission of aﬃrmative acts are preceded by some covert or overt conduct which\\nmay be divided into three stages. The ﬁrst stage exists when the culprit ﬁrst entertains\\nthe idea or intention to commit an offence. In the second stage, he makes preparations\\nto commit it. The third stage is reached when the culprit takes deliberate overt steps to\\ncommit the offence. Such overt act or step in order to be \\'criminal\\' need not be the\\npenultimate act towards the commission of the offence. It is suﬃcient if such act or\\nacts were deliberately done, and manifest a clear intention to commit the offence\\naimed, being reasonably proximate to the consummation of the offence.\\nThe test for determining whether the acts constitute attempt or preparation is whether\\nthe overt acts already done are such that if the offender changes his mind and does not\\nproceed further in its progress, the acts already done would be completely harmless.\\nBut where the thing done is such as, if not prevented by any extraneous cause, would\\nfructify into commission of an offence, it would amount to an attempt to commit that\\noffence.15. An attempt to commit an offence does not cease to be an attempt merely\\nbecause after the attempt is made and before the actual completion of the offence the\\noffender may be able to prevent its completion by doing some other act in pursuance\\nof a changed intention.16.\\nAn accused is liable for attempt where his failure to commit an offence is not due to\\nany act or omission of his own, but to the intervention of some factor independent of\\nhis own volition.17. Where misrepresentations had been made and money obtained\\nfrom the persons sought to be cheated by misrepresentations, there is an attempt to\\ncheat and not merely a preparation for committing that offence.18.'), ('511.4', 'Distinction between \\'preparation\\' and \\'attempt\\'.—\\nThere is a distinction between \\'preparation\\' and \\'attempt\\'. Attempt begins where\\npreparation ends. A person commits the offence of attempt to commit a particular\\noffence when accused (i) intends to commit a particular offence, (ii) he having made\\npreparation and with the intention to commit an offence, (iii) does an act towards its\\ncommission, such an act need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of\\nthat offence but must be an act during the course of committing that offence.19.\\nCode by an attempt to do an act, which if done will not be an offence against the\\nCode.20.\\nThe expression \"whoever attempts to commit an offence\" in this section can only mean\\n\"whoever intends to do a certain act with the intent or knowledge necessary for the\\ncommission of that offence\".21.'), ('511.5', \"Impossible offence.—\\nAn attempt is possible, even when the offence attempted cannot be committed; as\\nwhen a person, intending to pick another person's pocket, thrusts his hand into the\\npocket, but ﬁnds it empty. That such an act would amount to a criminal attempt\\nappears from the illustrations to this section. But in doing such an act, the offender's\\nintention is to commit a complete offence, and his act only falls short of the offence by\\nreason of an accidental circumstance which has prevented the completion of the\\noffence. It is possible to attempt to commit an impossible theft and so offend against\\nthe Code because theft is itself an offence against the Code, and may therefore, be\\nattempted within the meaning of the Code. At the same time it is necessary to show\\nthat the means adopted are apparently suitable for the fulﬁlment of the design.22. Thus\\nwhere a man threatens the life of another with a child's pop gun using a cork as a\\nprojectile23. or tries to pick the pocket of a man who is well beyond the reach of his\\nhand, no attempt either to commit murder or to steal can be said to have been\\ncommitted as the means adopted are impossible of achieving the designed purpose.\\nSimilar would be the case in regard to absolutely impossible acts. Thus where the act\\nis such that it is incapable of commission, e.g., trying to steal from an empty room or\\nan empty pocket or trying to kill a person by shooting at a bulge in a bed thinking it to\\nbe the enemy, no criminal attempt can be said to have been committed.24. In the IPC,\\n1860, however, trying to steal from an empty pocket would still constitute an attempt\\nas Illustration (b) to section 511, IPC, 1860 speciﬁcally says so. Though in England too\\nthis happened to be the law previously25. the position has materially changed after the\\ndecision of the House of Lords in Haughtons case.26. It is felt that the law in India\\nshould be changed on this score at least to bring about a uniformity of approach to this\\nquestion of attempt so far sections 307 and 511, IPC, 1860 are concerned especially,\\nafter the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Om Prakash's case,27. has held\\nthat under both these sections the act need not be the last proximate act.\"), ('511.6', \"Attempt to cheat.—\\nThe accused applied to the Patna University for permission to appear at the MA\\nExamination in English as a private candidate representing that he was a graduate\\nhaving obtained his BA degree three years earlier and that he had been teaching in a\\ncertain school. In support of his application, he attached certain certiﬁcates purporting\\nto be from the Headmaster of the School and the Inspector of Schools. The University\\nauthorities gave the accused permission to appear at the examination. Later on, ﬁnding\\nthat the certiﬁcates were false and that the accused was not a graduate and was not a\\nteacher, the University authorities withdrew the permission. The Supreme Court held\\nthat the accused was guilty of attempting to cheat and that the moment the accused\\ndispatched his application to the University, he entered the realm of attempting to\\ncommit the offence of cheating.28. Where the accused made an alteration in his own\\naﬃdavit under the honest belief that it was necessary for customs' clearance, the\\nSupreme Court set aside the conviction under section 420 read with this section.29.\\nThe offence of attempting to cheat may be committed even though the person\\nattempted to be cheated does not believe in the representations made to him and is\\nnot misled by them but only feigns belief in order to trap the offender.30.\"), ('511.7', 'Outraging Modesty of a Woman and attempt to Rape (sections 354\\nand 511 read with section 376).—\\n1956).\\n(SC).\\nIn between complete rape and attempt to commit rape there is a rare area covered by\\nsection 354 of IPC, 1860, i.e., assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage\\nher modesty or indecent assault. The dividing line between attempt to commit rape and\\nindecent assault is not only thin but also is practically invisible. For an offence of\\nattempt to commit rape, prosecution is required to establish that the act of the accused\\nwent beyond the stage of preparation. In a given case, where the prosecutrix was made\\nnaked and her cries attracted her uncle who came to the spot and then the accused\\nﬂed away, it was held that it was not a case of attempt to commit rape but was one\\nunder section 354 of IPC, 1860.31.'), ('511.8', \"'Attempt could be a minor offence'.—\\nIt is true that there was no charge under section 376 read with section 511, IPC, 1860.\\nHowever, under section 222 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973)\\nwhen a person is charged for an offence he may be convicted of an attempt to commit\\nsuch offence although the attempt is not separately charged.32.\\ncases of attempts made punishable by some speciﬁc sections of the Code.
